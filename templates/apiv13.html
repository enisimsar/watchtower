      "<span class="hljs-attribute">full_text</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"Introduction: Raspberry Pi and Arduino Laptop\n\nSince the day I heard about and got to play with the Raspberry Pi one a few years ago I've wanted to make a Raspberry Pi powered laptop out of it and now with the rease of the Raspberry Pi three I've decided to finally see it through. Now this isn't my first time attempting to make a fully working laptop using a Raspberry Pi, every other time I've tried the project has been riddled with errors with anything from broken ribbon cables to figuring out the hinge mechanism however I've been able to learn from these failures and I hope to show you how to avoid them when making your own. So lets get started!\n\nStep 1: What Do We Want It to Do\n\nBefore we can start choosing and buying the parts we are going to be using we need to figure out everything we want our laptop to be able to do, for example I want my laptop to have:\n\nintegrated mouse (trackpad)\n\nlong battery life\n\nat least 2 USB ports\n\nfull keyboard\n\nintegrated Arduino powered battery reader\n\nintegrated Arduino with headers for plugging components into\n\nsmall form factor\n\nSince we are using the Pi 3 we dont have to worry about buying a Wifi or Bluetooth dongle because it has it all integrated. Now this list is by no means exclusive, there are many other things that can be added to make this a better laptop however I think the features im adding will give it some awesome usability such as the integrated Arduino powered battery reader which will be a small OLED screen next to the main screen which will permanently show the battery percent and voltage, another feature I really like is the integrated Arduino with headers, this is basically an Arduino with male headers soldered to it, there are small holes cut in the case that allow the user to access the male pins and plug in components, so all this really is just an Arduino built into the laptop so we always have an Arduino handy.\n\nStep 2: Parts\n\nFor this project we will need quite a lot of parts, we will need:\n\nx1 Raspberry Pi 3 ( Here )\n\nx2 Arduino Micro ( Here )\n\nx1 Seven inch Raspberry PI screen ( Here )\n\nx3 Lithium 18650 Batteries ( Here )\n\nx1 Powerbank circuit ( Here )\n\nx1 USB hub ( Here )\n\nx1 Mini USB keyboard ( Here )\n\nx1 Male USB ( Here )\n\nx1 SPI OLED ( Here )\n\nReinforced cardboard\n\nWe are also going to need the trackpad we made in a previous project, you can find the full tutorial here . Once again this is by no means an exclusive list, whats nice about these parts is that the majority arent dependent on each other so you can swap parts for whatever you want. We have alot of parts to setup so to make it easier we are going to set them up individually and then at the end we can put them all together.\n\nStep 3: Setting Up the Pi and Screen\n\nLets start with our PI and screen, our screen doesn't connect to our Pi through the HDMI port but rather through a 50 pin ribbon cable that plugs into the Pis GPIO however if you just plug it in and start up the Pi it won't work, we need to edit some lines of code in the startup file for the Pi.\n\nWe start this by downloading a fresh Raspbian image Here , then we write it to our SD card using 7Zip (or whatever software works for you). Now once its written we need to open a file on the SD card called config.txt and add some code. What this code does is tell the Pi to send the screen data through the GPIO headers rather than the HDMI port (HDMI is the default) on startup. Putting the code in is really easy. Open the config.txt with a notepad program, for windows i'm using notepad ++, and copy this code into the config.txt file now save and close and it should work once the SD card is plugged back into the Pi. If it looks too bright or too dim turn the little petentiomoter on the screen circuit board until it looks right.\n\nOur Pi also needs to physical modification to fit inside our case properly we are going to have to desolder one of the duel usb ports, this is done by putting a fairly large amount of solder on the pins of the USB connector and slowly rocking it back and forth until it becomes free. We do this because we need to solder a usb hub to the Pi to plug in all of our input devices.\n\nThe code:\n\n&lt;p&gt;dtoverlay=dpi24&lt;br&gt;enable_dpi_lcd=1 display_default_lcd=1 dpi_group=2 dpi_mode=87 dpi_output_format=0x6f005 hdmi_cvt 1024 600 60 6 0 0 0&lt;/p&gt;\n\nStep 4: Setting Up the Battery\n\nOur battery uses 3 18650 batteries that have a capacity of 2400 mAh each, in parallel the 3 cells have a total capacity of 7200 mAh, our pi with everything plugged in draws around 1 Amp meaning our 3 cells can power the pi for roughly 4.5 - 5 hours but this can be increased by adding more batteries if you want. To build it we need to charge all 3 cells all the way up to 4.2 volts individually as connecting lithium cells is very dangerous if they have different charge states (different voltages) to avoid this its easiest to make sure they are all fully charged before connecting them.\n\nNow we want to connect these cells in parallel to do this we connect all the positive terminals together and then connect all the negative terminals together, use thick wire as a lot of current might pass between these batteries which would heat up a thinner wire. now connect the negative and postie terminal of the batteries to the negative and positive input terminals of the power bank circuit respectively and thats all for the battery!\n\nInstead of using a power bank circuit like I've used here you could use a lithium charger to charge the cells to 4.2 volts and boost converter to boost the 4.2 volts to 5 volts but this will ultimately do the exact same thing as the power bank circuit and would take up more space.\n\nStep 5: Setting Up the Battery Display\n\nNow to set up the battery display, this step is defiantly not that necessary as you could read the battery voltage through the Pis GPIO and display the battery level through software, however, I wanted to add this because I think the OLED screen gives the whole laptop a really cool DIY look. To make it we need to solder our OLED screen to our Arduino, the OLED im using is not an SPI version so I have to solder 7 pins to the Arduino.\n\nThe pinout is as follows:\n\nOLED-------------------Arduino\n\nRest - Pin 7\n\nDC - Pin 12\n\nCS - Pin 9\n\nDIN - Pin 11\n\nCLK - Pin 13\n\nVCC - 5 Volts\n\nGround - Ground\n\nBefore we can upload our code we have to make our voltage probes which will connect the Arduino to the battery and allow it to read the batteries voltage we need to solder 2 10 ohm resistors in a voltage divider configuration (see photos) to the A0 and Ground pins on the Arduino which can then be connected to the battery, A0 goes to positive and Ground goes to Ground. We also need a power source for our screen so we need to solder another wire to ground and one to VIN on the Arduino which we will connect to the power bank circuit later for power.\n\nFinally, we can upload our code which can be found below.\n\nStep 6: Setting Up the Rest of the Parts\n\nSo we've set up all the main parts and now all we need to set the smaller and easier parts. Starting with the keyboard, we need to remove it from the casing it came in (its intended to be used with a 7inch tablet) all we need to do is cut the fake leather around the keyboard and pull it and its circuit out, its that easy youll see there are 4 wires which we will solder to our USB hub later.\n\nThe track-pad also need minimal setup as all we need to do is take this one we made in a previous project and get a micro USB cable to plug it into our USB hub, you can see how this was made here .\n\nLastly our internal Arduino will need to have headers soldered onto all of its pins, its easiest to do this by putting these pins and the Arduino onto a breadboard and then soldering them in place as this will keep them straight, then we just get another micro USB cable to connect the Arduino to the USB hub. Now everything is set up so we can start putting things together!\n\nStep 7: The Circuit (Connecting Everything)\n\nAt this point we have individually put all the parts together now we need to connect them to each other to make the internals of our laptop.\n\nWe start by connecting the USB hub to one of the two USBs that we desoldered earlier, the second USB is then soldered to a female USB port which is placed on the other side of the laptop using some long wires, now solder the track-pad, Keyboard and internal Arduino to the USB hub. Next we solder the 5 volt output of our power bank circuit to the 5 volt input on the raspberry pi using a micro USB cable or even the dedicated 5 volt and ground solder pad that can be found under the Pi.\n\nThis is everything for the base now we can move onto the screen half there are only 2 parts in our screen, the main screen and battery display, all we need to do is connect the 50 pin ribbon cable to the main screen and to the 50 pin connector on the raspberry pi. Next we need to run 3 long cables from from the Arduino battery display, these are the battery read and power cables which we spoke about earlier, the cable connected to pin A0 get connected to the positive connection on the battery, the VIN pin gets connected to 5 volt output on the power bank circuit and ground goes to ground.\n\nOf course at some point we might want to turn this off so we are going to add a switch in between the ground connection from the power bank to the raspberry pi which allows us to completely cut power to the system. I do need to note that just cutting power to the raspberry pi is bad for it so preforming a software power down before cutting power is ideal, this can be done by just clicking shut down in the raspberry pi options.\n\nStep 8: The Case\n\nNow unfortunately i don't have a 3D printer but we can make a very sturdy and nice looking (my opinion) case from some malleable plastic and cardboard. The idea behind this is that the walls of the case will be made of a cardboard with the malleable plastic being used inside the case to keep everything together and make it sturdier. the key to doing this is measuring out the sizes of cardboard needed and cutting it out, the cardboard is then glued together with super glue, using hot glue at this point often leaves a visible lines which looks very ugly, the best think to do is put the pieces together using super glue and the reinforce it with hot glue on the inside followed by a layer of the malleable plastic. Ive left the dimensions for my case here if you choose to go this route however if you have a 3D printer i do think that is the neater options (let me see how it turns out in the comments!).\n\nStep 9: Screen Hinge\n\nWeirdly enough I found this part of the project to be the hardest even though it seems like such an easy part. What we need to do is get a very stiff hinge, I know its easier said than done but a good place to start looking is in old laptops or screen, you can find these for next to nothing at ewaiste facilities. once you have your hinge make a notch of the bottom of the screen and in the top of the base and full these notches with the malleable plastic I spoke about earlier. Now while its still warm and malleable begin pushing the hinge into it and secure it in place, because this stuff dries so hard there will be no issues with the hinge ever coming loose. If you make a mistake a hairdryer can be used to re melt the protoplatic and it can then be reshaped or removed.\n\nStep 10: Things to Look Out For/improve On\n\nWhile making this project I ran into quite a few issues that slowed me down or could have costed me a lot of money, the first and most annoying was the ribbon cable. Ribbon cables aren't designed to be plugged in and unplugged many times and unfortunately this is something I do a lot of while testing which actually broke mine from wear and tear (i ordered a new one) so make sure to be very careful with it. Another thing that annoyed me while testing this laptop was that I kept uploading code to the wrong internal Arduino! in the base we have 2 Arduinos plugged into the raspberry pi the first is the one controlling the trackpad and the second one is the Arduino we installed to used as an internal Arduino, the annoyance arises when I accidentally upload my sketch to the track-pad Arduino rather than the Arduino I wanted to upload it to, this of course messes with our track-pad making it unusable until we upload its code again so just make sure you know which Arduino is which in the Arduino IDE.\n\nWith all of that being said i have to say this isnt a very challenging project as there was minimal code required and the people over at the Raspberry Pi foundation have made the process of getting the Pi set up and working really easy.\n\nStep 11: Final\n\nAt this point the laptop is fully functional, i've been using mine almost everyday for taking notes, it works great for this as the Raspbian OS comes with libraoffice so using this as a school or work laptops is a really good idea. It also connects to WiFi and Bluetooth networks really easily making watching YouTube and other webpages really easy and to make it even better there are lots and lots of games that will run on the raspberry pi with anything from minecraft to classic old NES games making great fun with a long battery life. Overall this is a really fun project and I really recommend trying it.\n\nIf you have any questions please comment or send me a message and ill try my best to get back to you."</span></span>,

The idea of watching a movie on one would have been unthinkable at the time.\n\nThey were able to pull this off by connecting everyone’s favorite development board: an Arduino.

      "<span class="hljs-attribute">full_text</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"Introduction: Raspberry Pi and Arduino Laptop\n\nSince the day I heard about and got to play with the Raspberry Pi one a few years ago I've wanted to make a Raspberry Pi powered laptop out of it and now with the rease of the Raspberry Pi three I've decided to finally see it through. Now this isn't my first time attempting to make a fully working laptop using a Raspberry Pi, every other time I've tried the project has been riddled with errors with anything from broken ribbon cables to figuring out the hinge mechanism however I've been able to learn from these failures and I hope to show you how to avoid them when making your own. So lets get started!\n\nStep 1: What Do We Want It to Do\n\nBefore we can start choosing and buying the parts we are going to be using we need to figure out everything we want our laptop to be able to do, for example I want my laptop to have:\n\nintegrated mouse (trackpad)\n\nlong battery life\n\nat least 2 USB ports\n\nfull keyboard\n\nintegrated Arduino powered battery reader\n\nintegrated Arduino with headers for plugging components into\n\nsmall form factor\n\nSince we are using the Pi 3 we dont have to worry about buying a Wifi or Bluetooth dongle because it has it all integrated. Now this list is by no means exclusive, there are many other things that can be added to make this a better laptop however I think the features im adding will give it some awesome usability such as the integrated Arduino powered battery reader which will be a small OLED screen next to the main screen which will permanently show the battery percent and voltage, another feature I really like is the integrated Arduino with headers, this is basically an Arduino with male headers soldered to it, there are small holes cut in the case that allow the user to access the male pins and plug in components, so all this really is just an Arduino built into the laptop so we always have an Arduino handy.\n\nStep 2: Parts\n\nFor this project we will need quite a lot of parts, we will need:\n\nx1 Raspberry Pi 3 ( Here )\n\nx2 Arduino Micro ( Here )\n\nx1 Seven inch Raspberry PI screen ( Here )\n\nx3 Lithium 18650 Batteries ( Here )\n\nx1 Powerbank circuit ( Here )\n\nx1 USB hub ( Here )\n\nx1 Mini USB keyboard ( Here )\n\nx1 Male USB ( Here )\n\nx1 SPI OLED ( Here )\n\nReinforced cardboard\n\nWe are also going to need the trackpad we made in a previous project, you can find the full tutorial here . Once again this is by no means an exclusive list, whats nice about these parts is that the majority arent dependent on each other so you can swap parts for whatever you want. We have alot of parts to setup so to make it easier we are going to set them up individually and then at the end we can put them all together.\n\nStep 3: Setting Up the Pi and Screen\n\nLets start with our PI and screen, our screen doesn't connect to our Pi through the HDMI port but rather through a 50 pin ribbon cable that plugs into the Pis GPIO however if you just plug it in and start up the Pi it won't work, we need to edit some lines of code in the startup file for the Pi.\n\nWe start this by downloading a fresh Raspbian image Here , then we write it to our SD card using 7Zip (or whatever software works for you). Now once its written we need to open a file on the SD card called config.txt and add some code. What this code does is tell the Pi to send the screen data through the GPIO headers rather than the HDMI port (HDMI is the default) on startup. Putting the code in is really easy. Open the config.txt with a notepad program, for windows i'm using notepad ++, and copy this code into the config.txt file now save and close and it should work once the SD card is plugged back into the Pi. If it looks too bright or too dim turn the little petentiomoter on the screen circuit board until it looks right.\n\nOur Pi also needs to physical modification to fit inside our case properly we are going to have to desolder one of the duel usb ports, this is done by putting a fairly large amount of solder on the pins of the USB connector and slowly rocking it back and forth until it becomes free. We do this because we need to solder a usb hub to the Pi to plug in all of our input devices.\n\nThe code:\n\n&lt;p&gt;dtoverlay=dpi24&lt;br&gt;enable_dpi_lcd=1 display_default_lcd=1 dpi_group=2 dpi_mode=87 dpi_output_format=0x6f005 hdmi_cvt 1024 600 60 6 0 0 0&lt;/p&gt;\n\nStep 4: Setting Up the Battery\n\nOur battery uses 3 18650 batteries that have a capacity of 2400 mAh each, in parallel the 3 cells have a total capacity of 7200 mAh, our pi with everything plugged in draws around 1 Amp meaning our 3 cells can power the pi for roughly 4.5 - 5 hours but this can be increased by adding more batteries if you want. To build it we need to charge all 3 cells all the way up to 4.2 volts individually as connecting lithium cells is very dangerous if they have different charge states (different voltages) to avoid this its easiest to make sure they are all fully charged before connecting them.\n\nNow we want to connect these cells in parallel to do this we connect all the positive terminals together and then connect all the negative terminals together, use thick wire as a lot of current might pass between these batteries which would heat up a thinner wire. now connect the negative and postie terminal of the batteries to the negative and positive input terminals of the power bank circuit respectively and thats all for the battery!\n\nInstead of using a power bank circuit like I've used here you could use a lithium charger to charge the cells to 4.2 volts and boost converter to boost the 4.2 volts to 5 volts but this will ultimately do the exact same thing as the power bank circuit and would take up more space.\n\nStep 5: Setting Up the Battery Display\n\nNow to set up the battery display, this step is defiantly not that necessary as you could read the battery voltage through the Pis GPIO and display the battery level through software, however, I wanted to add this because I think the OLED screen gives the whole laptop a really cool DIY look. To make it we need to solder our OLED screen to our Arduino, the OLED im using is not an SPI version so I have to solder 7 pins to the Arduino.\n\nThe pinout is as follows:\n\nOLED-------------------Arduino\n\nRest - Pin 7\n\nDC - Pin 12\n\nCS - Pin 9\n\nDIN - Pin 11\n\nCLK - Pin 13\n\nVCC - 5 Volts\n\nGround - Ground\n\nBefore we can upload our code we have to make our voltage probes which will connect the Arduino to the battery and allow it to read the batteries voltage we need to solder 2 10 ohm resistors in a voltage divider configuration (see photos) to the A0 and Ground pins on the Arduino which can then be connected to the battery, A0 goes to positive and Ground goes to Ground. We also need a power source for our screen so we need to solder another wire to ground and one to VIN on the Arduino which we will connect to the power bank circuit later for power.\n\nFinally, we can upload our code which can be found below.\n\nStep 6: Setting Up the Rest of the Parts\n\nSo we've set up all the main parts and now all we need to set the smaller and easier parts. Starting with the keyboard, we need to remove it from the casing it came in (its intended to be used with a 7inch tablet) all we need to do is cut the fake leather around the keyboard and pull it and its circuit out, its that easy youll see there are 4 wires which we will solder to our USB hub later.\n\nThe track-pad also need minimal setup as all we need to do is take this one we made in a previous project and get a micro USB cable to plug it into our USB hub, you can see how this was made here .\n\nLastly our internal Arduino will need to have headers soldered onto all of its pins, its easiest to do this by putting these pins and the Arduino onto a breadboard and then soldering them in place as this will keep them straight, then we just get another micro USB cable to connect the Arduino to the USB hub. Now everything is set up so we can start putting things together!\n\nStep 7: The Circuit (Connecting Everything)\n\nAt this point we have individually put all the parts together now we need to connect them to each other to make the internals of our laptop.\n\nWe start by connecting the USB hub to one of the two USBs that we desoldered earlier, the second USB is then soldered to a female USB port which is placed on the other side of the laptop using some long wires, now solder the track-pad, Keyboard and internal Arduino to the USB hub. Next we solder the 5 volt output of our power bank circuit to the 5 volt input on the raspberry pi using a micro USB cable or even the dedicated 5 volt and ground solder pad that can be found under the Pi.\n\nThis is everything for the base now we can move onto the screen half there are only 2 parts in our screen, the main screen and battery display, all we need to do is connect the 50 pin ribbon cable to the main screen and to the 50 pin connector on the raspberry pi. Next we need to run 3 long cables from from the Arduino battery display, these are the battery read and power cables which we spoke about earlier, the cable connected to pin A0 get connected to the positive connection on the battery, the VIN pin gets connected to 5 volt output on the power bank circuit and ground goes to ground.\n\nOf course at some point we might want to turn this off so we are going to add a switch in between the ground connection from the power bank to the raspberry pi which allows us to completely cut power to the system. I do need to note that just cutting power to the raspberry pi is bad for it so preforming a software power down before cutting power is ideal, this can be done by just clicking shut down in the raspberry pi options.\n\nStep 8: The Case\n\nNow unfortunately i don't have a 3D printer but we can make a very sturdy and nice looking (my opinion) case from some malleable plastic and cardboard. The idea behind this is that the walls of the case will be made of a cardboard with the malleable plastic being used inside the case to keep everything together and make it sturdier. the key to doing this is measuring out the sizes of cardboard needed and cutting it out, the cardboard is then glued together with super glue, using hot glue at this point often leaves a visible lines which looks very ugly, the best think to do is put the pieces together using super glue and the reinforce it with hot glue on the inside followed by a layer of the malleable plastic. Ive left the dimensions for my case here if you choose to go this route however if you have a 3D printer i do think that is the neater options (let me see how it turns out in the comments!).\n\nStep 9: Screen Hinge\n\nWeirdly enough I found this part of the project to be the hardest even though it seems like such an easy part. What we need to do is get a very stiff hinge, I know its easier said than done but a good place to start looking is in old laptops or screen, you can find these for next to nothing at ewaiste facilities. once you have your hinge make a notch of the bottom of the screen and in the top of the base and full these notches with the malleable plastic I spoke about earlier. Now while its still warm and malleable begin pushing the hinge into it and secure it in place, because this stuff dries so hard there will be no issues with the hinge ever coming loose. If you make a mistake a hairdryer can be used to re melt the protoplatic and it can then be reshaped or removed.\n\nStep 10: Things to Look Out For/improve On\n\nWhile making this project I ran into quite a few issues that slowed me down or could have costed me a lot of money, the first and most annoying was the ribbon cable. Ribbon cables aren't designed to be plugged in and unplugged many times and unfortunately this is something I do a lot of while testing which actually broke mine from wear and tear (i ordered a new one) so make sure to be very careful with it. Another thing that annoyed me while testing this laptop was that I kept uploading code to the wrong internal Arduino! in the base we have 2 Arduinos plugged into the raspberry pi the first is the one controlling the trackpad and the second one is the Arduino we installed to used as an internal Arduino, the annoyance arises when I accidentally upload my sketch to the track-pad Arduino rather than the Arduino I wanted to upload it to, this of course messes with our track-pad making it unusable until we upload its code again so just make sure you know which Arduino is which in the Arduino IDE.\n\nWith all of that being said i have to say this isnt a very challenging project as there was minimal code required and the people over at the Raspberry Pi foundation have made the process of getting the Pi set up and working really easy.\n\nStep 11: Final\n\nAt this point the laptop is fully functional, i've been using mine almost everyday for taking notes, it works great for this as the Raspbian OS comes with libraoffice so using this as a school or work laptops is a really good idea. It also connects to WiFi and Bluetooth networks really easily making watching YouTube and other webpages really easy and to make it even better there are lots and lots of games that will run on the raspberry pi with anything from minecraft to classic old NES games making great fun with a long battery life. Overall this is a really fun project and I really recommend trying it.\n\nIf you have any questions please comment or send me a message and ill try my best to get back to you."</span></span>,

The coop consist of the inner part where the chickens eat, drink, sleep and lay their eggs and an outer part that extends outside the dome, where the chickens always could go out if the door fails to open automatically or any other thing should go wrong. on the end of the outside part I installed a door that automatically opens/closes accordingly to a calculated sunrise/sunset times, based on my geographically location.\n\nFor the eggs i tried making a roll away system that would let the eggs roll into a box where i then later could collect them if i was gone for a longer periode of time. This unfortunately didn't work ass planed and i had to place hay on there to make the use the system, which didn't allow for the eggs to roll into the box.\n\nFor water supply i used chicken fowls that automatically fills up. For the chicken feed i had a tube going into the coop with a hole in it and a barrel on top of it, containing about 25 kg of feed that also automatically filled up.\n\nIn the summertime the chickens are fenced in so that they dont eat the crops around the dome and in winter time when the crops are mostly harversted the fence is open and the chickens are free to go wherever they desire. The species of chickens I've choose was Icelandic chickens, whom are very good at finding their own food, unfortunately they are also very good at flying and even though I cut their flying feathers of on one side the thin ones of them are still able to escape the 1,8 meter fence sometimes and a game of cat and mouse is on."</span></span>,

      "<span class="hljs-attribute">full_text</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"What is Arduino Create?\n\nArduino Create is an online platform that enables makers to write code, access tutorials, configure boards, and share projects. Designed to provide users with a continuous workflow, Arduino Create connects the dots between each part of a maker’s journey from inspiration to implementation.\n\nIf you have an Intel-based platform, such as an Intel Nuc, Up2 Board, Dell Wyse, Gigabyte GB-BXT or any other gateway with Ethernet connection, you can easily set it up by following a simple guide.\n\nOnce you have configured your device, you will be able to upload sketches from anywhere in the world via the Cloud. You will be also able to interact with all the processes running on the Gateway; for instance you can stop and start your programs, read their output, or monitor their behavior.\n\nAll you need to get started is an Arduino Profile.\n\nSign up to Arduino\n\nCreate a new Arduino Account at this link. Complete the registration form, then hit the ‘Create Account’ button. You will receive an email with a link to activate your account. Select the link and a new page will open with your confirmed account information.\n\nNote that you can also use this account to write posts on Arduino’s official Forum, buy products on the online store, add comments on the blog, as well as create tutorials on the Arduino Project Hub (YAY!).\n\nLog in the Arduino Web Editor\n\nOnce you have successfully registered for an Arduino account, go to the Getting Started Web app and log in. Then press Set Up a generic Intel-based platform.\n\nSetup your device to communicate with Create\n\nAfter having read the welcome page that lists all the steps you will go through, you can pick the installation flow that best suits your needs:\n\nA. You are just unpacking your brand new device\n\nIf you have just purchased your device and this is your first time using it this is the flow for you. If the device is brand new chances are really high that no OS has been installed on it yet. But no worries we are going to install it together, just make sure you have a USB stick at hand.\n\nSelect Option 2 (on the right).\n\nTo be able to correctly install a Linux distribution on your gateway we need to create a new user and set a password. You will be able to use these credentials to access your Gateway if you connect to it via SSH or if you plug it into a screen and keyboard.\n\nIf you require a proxy to be configure to access the internet, you will be able to set it up on this page.\n\nSelect the Linux distribution you prefer and then press the 'Download OS' button. We recommend you use Ubuntu for generic Gateways.\n\nPlease Look for a file called arduino-connector.img in your Download folder.\n\nNow that we have a customized OS we are going to flash it on a USB stick, to do so we will use Etcher but you can use any other software you may already have on your PC.\n\nSo download Etcher and install it on your PC. Run Etcher and follow the instructions to flash the USB key: select the arduino-connect.img file, plug in the USB key and hit 'Flash'. Please note that all the content previously stored on your USB will be erased in this process. Also note that you might be asked to enter your PC's password to complete this process.\n\nAs soon as the USB is ready you will get a success message from Etcher. Your OS might complain that the USB stick will be not readable, just ignore the message and eject it.\n\nNow you can quit Etcher and go back to the Getting Started guide in the browser.\n\nWe are now ready to install the customized OS on your device.\n\nFirst thing to do is checking if your device can boot from USB, here are some guides on how to change the booting order. Once you are sure about the order, plug the USB key in your device, connect it to Internet via Ethernet and turn it on, you can do so by simply and plugging the power jack in.\n\nThe installation process has now started!\n\nIf something goes wrong (for instance the progress bar gets stuck for a very long time) you can try to flash a new USB key or check your Internet connection. Please note that you cannot reuse the same USB stick for multiple Gateways and you must always restart the flow from the very beginning.\n\nIn general you need to be a bit patient during this unattended flow, as it can take up to 30 minutes according to your Internet connection.\n\nOnce the process has been successfully completed you will be asked to remove the USB key from you Gateway.\n\nYou are all set! You are ready to jump to the last part of this guide.\n\nB. You have already installed an OS on your device\n\nIf an OS is already running on your Gateway you can select the button on the right. You should now connect your device to Internet via Ethernet and turn it on, you can do so by simply and plugging the power jack in. When ready go to the next screen.\n\nYou are now presented with 2 options, (1) Enter your device IP address or (2) Connect a screen and a keyboard to the device.\n\nB1. Enter your device IP\n\nIf you know your device IP address you can simply write it in the text field. You can use services like Angry IP Scanner to check what devices are available on your network and what is their IP.\n\nOnce you have entered the IP address you will be asked to enter your Gateway username and password. If you are behind proxy you can also set it up here.\n\nThat's it! You will need to wait for the installation process to be completed and you will be ready to go.\n\nB2. Connect a screen and keyboard to your Gateway\n\nIf you have a screen and keyboard at hand you can connect them to your Gateway. Now just open the Terminal on the device and type the script displayed on your PC. Run the 4 commands one by one.\n\nAt the end of this progress bar the installation flow will be completed.\n\nFinishing up the installation\n\nYou have successfully completed the installation (using either the USB, the IP or the Script)! You will be now asked to give your Gateway a name so you will be able to recognize it when you access it from My Devices app and the Online Editor.\n\nMy Devices web app\n\nMy Devices allows you to see all the cloud-enabled boards and products that you have setup and are linked to your account. From here you can see what processes are running on each board and stop or start them.\n\nSince we have just completed the first configuration flow nothing is running on the device Livingroom_lamp . Click on 'Nothing Running', a modal with a link to upload a sketch will be displayed.\n\nThe online editor will be open, and you are now able to upload any sketch to your Gateway by selecting it as a target in the dropdown.\n\nFor more infos on how to use the online editor follow this tutorial.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf something goes wrong in this installation process you can let us know on the Arduino Forum. Keep in mind that this guide has been tested in depth only on the Intel Nuc and the Up2 Board."</span></span>,

      "<span class="hljs-attribute">full_text</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"The Critter is the fifth robot in the LittleBot family of 3D printed arduino robots. We had already made arms and wheeled robots, we knew that with the next one we wanted was a walking robot. But while creating the new walking robot we had to ensure that we met the same quality of design for easy assembly that we established with all of our other kits.\n\nWalking\n\nWalking robots are generally pretty complex. They generally require a lot of calibration, precision, and special programming to operate effectively. When we decided to build a walking robot we knew that it couldn't be a traditional system. We needed something that was easy and rugged enough for kids to build while still being interesting enough for hobbyists at higher levels.\n\nWe took a little inspiration from mudskippers and the first animals to crawl out of the ocean. We knew that it would be a belly-dragger, and that is where the similarity ended.\n\nThe LittleBot uses its two front legs to drag itself along. This gives it many of the capabilities of walking robots, such as traversing difficult terrains, while not having the downsides (falling over when a program is bad). This lets new roboticists experiment with code without having to worry about damaging the robot as much.\n\nEasy to Build\n\nLargely Snap Together Constuction (The kit only has 12 screws)\n\nArduino Based\n\n3D Printed\n\nSince we simplified how the walking was to be done we were able to use many of the standards we created with our previous kits.\n\nThe Legs themselves only have 8 screws (4 apiece), and since we design for 3D printing a large majority of makers and schools can build the kits from scratch without a great deal of difficulty.\n\nThe electronics of the Critter are based around the Meped board. This custom PCB allows simple connection of bluetooth, sensors and even wifi. The board greatly reduces the complexity of the electronics. Instead of having to go through complicated circuit diagrams it is basically just plug and play. Using this board within a few minutes you have a robot that can see the world with its ultrasonic eyes and start moving.\n\nEvery single plastic part on the Critter is 3D printed. Since we designed it this way there are only 6 3D printed parts in the Kit and less than 2 dozen parts total (not counting the 12 screws). Making the Critter 3D printed ensured that anyone can build one anywhere in the world to take advantage of what it can offer.\n\nThe other advantage of 3D printing is that students can change and add to it. We will be releasing details of the Critter design so that kids can design new features like feet for his legs that provide different amounts of traction, or even extra sensors added to his shell.\n\nEasy to Reprogram\n\nSince the Critter is a based entirely on Arduino its code is very well supported. We work to post tutorials and explanations of the code on each of our robot kits. And the wider Arduino community provides resources and tutorials on basic programming concepts.\n\nAdditionally, since the Critter uses Arduino it can be programmed with graphic programming tools such as Scratch and Blockly, reducing the stress on new programmers to learn syntax.\n\nJust Fun to Play With\n\nThe Critter can be operated with an Android app that we have created. The app allows for \"driving\" the Critter around, activating \"Autonomous Wander Mode,\" (where they Critter uses his eyes and various internal behaviors to wander) and executing various motions such as waving and dancing.\n\nAll of the parts and the 3D printing files for the Critter can be found on the LittleBots Website."</span></span>,

      "<span class="hljs-attribute">full_text</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"Intro\n\nFirst off, let's say the obvious: we like to do family costumes.\n\nLast year we did space \"aliens\" which really looked more like people dressed in silver with LED strip accents. We really liked the LEDs since they are unique and make the kids easy to see when they are running around at night. We decided to do something that lights up again, but weren't sure what. It was my daughter that suggested Pac-Man, since she had recently played the Namco gem at a bowling alley a few weeks prior. That suggestion was all we would need. It was a great idea and we had to make it happen.\n\nPlanning\n\nThe first step is always planning, but hey its worth noting, especially if you want to do a different 8-bit character.\n\nWe chose Pac-Man characters for the family. Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, and the ghosts Blinky and Pinky. I wanted it to be accurate and authentic to the original 8-bit characters so I began by looking up the original game sprites.\n\nPac-Man Game Sprites\n\nThese help ensure we are getting the correct pixel pixel layout and shows each frame of the animations. For instance you can see the different frames of the ghost legs and Pac-Man's mouth in the sprites above.\n\nI then laid out each frame of the animations in Excel so we know where the number of LEDs and the overall layout of each board. The individual numbers of the LEDs are needed later for programming the Arduino board.\n\nExcel Layout of Sprites\n\nYou can see by the layout that the Ghosts are 14 pixels in height by 14 pixels in width. Pac-Man is 13x13 and Ms.Pac-Man is 14x14.\n\nOnce we knew the width and height by pixels we have to decide how big we wanted to make the panels. I wanted them all to be the same size relative to one another. Meaning each pixel would be the same size on each costume. To scale them properly we started by making sure it would be the right size for the smallest family member, my son. I measure him and held up some cardboard cutouts tosee what size he could still comfortably put his arms over and still walk. We ended up at 22\" as the size of the ghosts in height and width.\n\nThat set our scale 22\" / 14 pixels = 1.57\"/pixel.\n\nMaterials\n\nWe wanted the costumes to be relatively easily worn around so we opted for light materials rather than durable ones.\n\nBase: 1/8\" cardboard, laser cut and hot glued\n\nTranslucent Cover: Drafting Paper (Vellum or Mylar)\n\nLEDs : 12mm DC5V WS2811 Individually Addressable LEDs (Strings of 50)\n\nBoard: Ardunio Uno R3\n\nPower: 5V DC Portable Power Supply (Like a portable phone charger) + USB to DC Adapter\n\nMisc: DC Power Jack Adapters Breadboard jumper wires DC5V Power Supply, for testing Velcro Woven Duct Strap Duct Tape\n\nThe Base\n\nFirst off, I have access to a laser cutter, so I knew I would be using it to make these. These can still be made by hand cutting the cardboard, but if you have access to a laser cutter I would recommend using it.\n\nThe base is made from 1/8\" cardboard sheets purchased from the local art/hobby store. Our laser cutter has a 32\"x18\" bed so I had them cut the sheets down to that size.\n\nI then modeled the base in 3d using Rhino. Accurately modeling the base and cardboard allowed me to create the base framework in a way that would slide and notch together without the need for much glue, while also ensuring we would get perfect squares for pixels.\n\n3d model of base\n\nLaser cutter in action CAD Files for Laser Cutter Base backboard\n\nIf you are going to do it by hand you can easily lay this out and cut strips of cardboard to do the same thing. The pixels are about 1.5\" square and 2\" deep with a hole in the middle for the LEDs.\n\nNotes: We used 12mm LEDs and that's what I sized the holes to. The LEDs went in nicely, but since it is cardboard they got a little loose, espescially if I had to take the LEDs out and put them back in. If I were to redo it I would make those holes slightly smaller.\n\nThe slots and notches are 1/32\" bigger (1/64\" on either side) than the 1/8\" cardboard to allow them to slide together. This was the right tolerance for the\n\nLED Layout\n\nThe planning for the LEDs strings occurred in Excel where I laid out the individual LEDs in order from 0-169 for the Ghosts.\n\nThe important things to note are the distances between pixels and the start point.\n\nIf you don't want to cut and rewire the pre-strung lights you need to make sure you can reach from one hole to the other in your sequence. In my case distance between the individual LEDs on the pre-strung bundle is about 3 inches (75mm). This meant the pixels had to be adjacent to one another when laying them out. For the starting point just make sure it is close to where you can mount the Arduino and power supply.\n\nFollowing the pattern laid out in Excel we push the LEDs from the back into place in the cardboard. The LEDs have a small flange that keeps them somewhat in place. The cardboard is a bit flimsy so the LEDs tended to move around a bit. If you want to keep them in place more securely you could hot glue them in place.\n\nWiring\n\nPower Supply\n\nI used a 8xAA Battery Pack with an On/Off switch. This is another piece I had around from the previous year's costumes. Its only while writing this did I realize it has a 12V output and I was using 5V LEDs. Since I had the battery pack around I just picked it up and plugged it in and everything worked and I didn't second guess it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nI recommend getting the correct 5V DC power supply. If I were to do it again I would get a standard phone charger and a USB to 5V adapter to plug into the LEDs.\n\nMake sure it has a lot of capacity, 20,000+ mAh, the 8AA batteries I used would be around that and they lasted for right about 2 hours of on-time. You might get different results depending on # of LEDs and what brightness you have them set to.\n\nLEDs\n\nI used strings of 12mm WS2811 individually addressable LEDs for outdoor signage. I bought them on Amazon and they came in strings of 50.\n\nWiring\n\nThe wiring of the power to the lights and then to the board is done as shown in the diagram and photo.\n\nThe lead LED on the first string has an power in connection, there are two wires (hot/red and ground/white). These are connected to a female power jack adapter. The power supply is plugged into this adapter. Then we connect the power, ground, and data from that first LED's are connected to the 5v and GND connections on the Arduino and the DATA (middle) wire connects to the 3 PIN on the board.\n\nMake sure you check your string of LEDs before wiring it up. My LED wires were Red(5V), Green (DATA), White(GND), but yours may be different.\n\nNotes: When using the USB to power the Arduino, unplug the 5V connection, but leave the GND Do not mix up the 5v and GND - that can fry your board. I know from experience, it doesn't smell good.\n\nCode\n\nOnce you are all wired up the lights won't do anything. Maybe blink. They need to be told to do something first and this is how I did it.\n\nI am not covering how to program an Arduino board, I am assuming you know how to do that.\n\nI used the FastLED library for these. Its easy to use and easy to find examples to help figure everything out.\n\nBelow is the code for the Ghost. The basic outline for the logic is to fill all LEDs with the main color, then change the color of, and turn off the individual sets of LEDs to make each \"frame\". Once we have a set for each \"frame\" of the animation, we loop through them at X speed X number of times to make up the whole animation. There may be a smarter way of doing this, but this is how I did it and it worked for me!\n\nThe animation in action\n\nNotes: You can turn the brightness up and down it will have an effect on how long the batteries last. Change the //fill body color to change the color of the Ghost (its Red below) You can change the speed of the animations by changing the number and speed of the loops\n\nAdd the Cover\n\nWithout Cover With Cover\n\nI recommend leaving the cover to the end since it is made of paper and can rip. It is also useful to be able to reach the LEDs from the front when you are putting them in place or making adjustments.\n\nI used a roll of drafting paper I had lying around. I am pretty sure it is vellum, but it might be mylar. Either way what you want to a translucent paper that is wide enough to cover the whole thing so you don't have to deal with a seam. You can get rolls of drafting paper at an art store or online.\n\nTo keep the paper in place I put a line of regular old Elmers glue along the top edge of the vertical fins. I didn't do the ones horizontal ones as all you really need is for the paper to stay mostly in place. Keeping the paper glued down makes sure the grid read through and make the panel look like individual pixels.\n\nAfter you get the glue down lay the paper on top and put books or something heavy-ish on top to keep it in place and let the glue set.\n\nOnce the glue sets you can cut the excess paper off. Leave a little extra bit of paper around the edges to fold over and tape down, this helps ensure the edges won't peel up or come loose.\n\nRoad Ready\n\nFor the finishing steps we get it ready to go on the road.\n\nMount the Arduino and power supply to the back with Velcro\n\nTape the connections together so they don't come loose\n\nAdd a strap to carry it around. I used woven duct strap for this (like the drafting paper I had it around).\n\nLoad up some Pac-Man music and sound effects on your phone and bring a bluetooth speaker\n\nProfit\n\nOnce you are all done you can send out your 8-bit family into the neighborhood to impress the neighbors and collect your sweet sweet candy profits.\n\nThanks for reading! If you have any questions feel free to ask!"</span></span>,

      "<span class="hljs-attribute">full_text</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"10 Years of Data Science Visualizations\n\nMy career in data science started a decade ago, when I took my first machine learning course at UC Santa Cruz. Since then, I’ve worked on a variety of teams and used a number of different visualization tools. While a lot of my experience in industry has been focused on business and product metrics, I wanted to share some of the visualizations I’ve put together over the past 10 years. I’ve picked a single visualization from each year over the past decade, with the goal of showing how my preference for different tools has changed over time. These aren’t necessarily the most impactful visualizations from each year, because that list would be too excel focused and might expose sensitive information. Here’s the timeline for my visualization tool preference over the past 10 years:\n\n2007\n\nBack before deep learning dominated the task of image classification, AdaBoost was a popular approach for machine learning tasks, such as face detection. During my first year of graduate school at UC Santa Cruz, I took Manfred Warmuth’s machine learning course. His course introduced me to a variety of tools including MATLAB and Mathematica. For my term project, I implemented Viola and Jones’ image detection algorithm in MATLAB and applied it to the task of detecting aircraft in images, with the results shown in the image below. The classifier didn’t perform well, mostly due to a lack of quality training data and a limited set of features (Haar basis functions).\n\nAircraft Image Detection — MATLAB- UC Santa Cruz (CMPS 242)\n\nThe banner image for this blog post was generated as part of this project. The image shows detected faces for some of the validation data set images.\n\n2008\n\nFor my dissertation project, I wanted to build a system that learns from demonstration, and was inspired by professional StarCraft players. Before the Brood War API was released, making it possible to write bots for StarCraft, it was possible to analyze data from replays using tools such as the LM replay browser. The image below shows some of the preliminary work from my analysis of professional replays. I wrote a Java application that drew dots and lines corresponding to troop movements during a StarCraft game.\n\nStarCraft: Brood War Gameplay Traces —Java — UC Santa Cruz\n\n2009\n\nAfter collecting and mining thousands of replays, I trained various classification algorithms to detect different build orders in StarCraft 1. The results from this analysis are shown in the excel chart below. One of the interesting results from this analysis was that some of the algorithms outperformed the ruleset classifier used to label the images. I published this result and other findings at IEEE CIG 2009.\n\nStarCraft 1 Build Order Prediction — Excel — UC Santa Cruz (EISBot)\n\nA few months ago, I wrote a blog post about how I would have would have approached this analysis today, given my current preference for scripting and visualization tools.\n\n2010\n\nDuring my internship at Electronic Arts in fall 2010, I had the opportunity to data mine terabytes of data collected from Madden NFL 11. One of the analyses I performed was looking at different player archetypes in Madden, based on preferred gameplay modes. I used Weka to perform this task and the results are shown in the PCA visualization below. During my internship at EA, I also working on modeling player retention and pulled data on some interesting business metrics.\n\nPlayer Archetypes in Madden NFL 11 — Weka — Electronic Arts\n\n2011\n\nOne of the challenges I faced in building a StarCraft bot was dealing with the fog of war, which restricts a player’s visibility of the map. I created a particle model to track enemy units that were previously observed by no longer within the bot’s vision. I wrote a script using Java to create the video below that visualizes the bot’s observations. The results were published at AIIDE 2011.\n\nState Estimation in StarCraft — Java — UC Santa Cruz (EISBot)\n\n2012\n\nThe last visualization I’ll present from my dissertation project is a graph showing the actions in the agent’s behavior tree, which it uses for decision making. The bot is authored in the ABL reactive planning language, and I wrote a script in Java to parse the code and output a graph format. I then used the protoviz library to create a rendering of the graph.\n\nEISBot’s Behavior Tree — Protoviz— UC Santa Cruz (EISBot)\n\n2013\n\nWhile working on the Studio User Research team at Microsoft, I helped the team build visualizations for playtesting of Ryse: Son of Rome and Sunset Overdrive. Deborah Hendersen presented some of the results of this work at GDC 2017. The image below shows enemy death locations for a playtest session visualized using Tableau. We found that including visualizations in addition to feedback from participants resulted in game studios paying more attention to the reports.\n\nRyse: Son of Rome Playtesting — Tableau — Microsoft Studios User Research\n\n2014\n\nAt Sony Online Entertainment, I continued using Tableau for reporting business metrics and for putting together visualizations of player activity in our MMOs. Some of the most impactful visualizations I put together were player funnels, which showed where players were dropping off during gameplay. I also made a bunch of heatmaps, which didn’t result in as many actionable results, but did get more attention from game teams.\n\nActivity heatmap in DC Universe Online — Tableau — Sony Online Entertainment\n\n2015\n\nAt Electronic Arts, I made the switch to R for the majority of my analysis, and started exploring a variety of visualization tools in the R ecosystem, including Shiny and htmlwidgets. One of the projects I worked on at EA was a server for running the analytics team’s R scripts. I wrote a shiny script to create a web app that visualized server load, shown in image below. I presented the RServer project at useR! 2016. However, my current recommendation would be for teams to use a more mature project such as Airflow.\n\nRServer Load — R(Shiny) + dygraphs package — Electronic Arts (Global Analytics &amp; Insights)\n\n2016\n\nThe science team at Twitch does a fair amount of A/B experimentation to determine which features to rollout to the user base. We also encountered a situation where A/B testing was not practical, and instead used a staged rollout to analyze the impact of a significant app rewrite. I used the CausalImpact package in R to evaluate the impact of the staged rollout on the number of app sessions, with the results shown below. I previously discussed this approach in more detail here.\n\nStaged rollout impact on mobile sessions — R + CausalImpact package — Twitch\n\n2017\n\nI’m continuing to use R for visualizations, even though I recently switched from the gaming industry to finance technology. One change I have made is doing more of my analysis in Jupyter notebooks rather than RStudio. In the coming months I’ll be writing more blog posts about the type of analysis I’m doing at Windfall Data. For now, here’s a US population heatmap generated from census data."</span></span>,

      "<span class="hljs-attribute">full_text</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"A Data Science Workflow\n\nThe Jupyter Notebook can be found here.\n\nThere is no template for solving a data science problem. The roadmap changes with every new dataset and new problem. But we do see similar steps in many different projects. I wanted to make a clean workflow to serve as an example to aspiring data scientists. I also wanted to give people working with data scientists an easy to understand guide to data science.\n\nThis is a high-level overview and every step (and almost every sentence) in this overview can be addressed on its own. Many books like Introduction to Statistical Learning by Hastie and Tibshirani and many courses like Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course at Stanford, go into these topics in more detail. The data science community is full of great literature and great resources. Be sure to dive deeper into any topic you find interesting.\n\nOverview:\n\nObjective Importing Data Data Exploration and Data Cleaning Baseline Modeling Secondary Modeling Communicating Results Conclusion Resources\n\nLastly, I want to say that this process isn’t completely linear. You will jump around as you learn more about the data and find new problems to solve along the way.\n\nLet’s get started!\n\n1) The Objective\n\nWhat is the problem you are trying to solve? Remove modeling, evaluation metrics, and data science from the equation. What is the problem your company faces? What do you want to learn more about? Clearly **stating your problem** is the first step to solving it and without a clear problem, you could find yourself down a data-science rabbit-hole.\n\nFor this workflow, we are going to analyze the highest ranked movies on IMDB.com. I want to build a model to predict IMDB movie rating based on features like budget, runtime, and votes on the website.\n\n2) Importing Data\n\nData can come from a variety of sources. You can import CSV files from your local machine, query SQL servers, or use a web scraper to strip data from the Internet. I like to use the Python library, **Pandas**, to import data. Pandas is a great open-source data analysis library. We will also be using Pandas in the data cleaning step of this workflow.\n\nFor this example, we are going to import data from our local machine. I will be using a dataset from Kaggle.com’s user Sai Pranav. The dataset is titled “Top Ranked English Movies of this Decade” and it was in a CSV file.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(‘/Users/aakashtandel/Downloads/IMDB.csv’, index_col=0, encoding=’latin-1')\n\nI do want to say right off the bat that this dataset is pretty small. The number of observations is relatively few. But because this is only an example problem, I am okay with proceeding. In industry, you would definitely want a larger dataset.\n\n3) Data Exploration\n\nNow that we have our data imported into Pandas, we can check out the first few rows of our dataframe.\n\ndf.head()\n\nThere are three distinctions I like to make from the get-go. Is this supervised learning or unsupervised learning? Is this a classification problem or is it a regression problem? Is this a prediction problem or an inference problem?\n\nSupervised or Unsupervised Learning: With Supervised learning, we have clearly labeled dependent and independent variables. The dependent variable (our target) is known. If we are looking at a linear regression, our y variable is obvious. If we do have a clearly labeled y variable, we are performing supervised learning because the computer is learning from our clearly labeled dataset. It is learning the relationship between our x variables and our y variables. Supervised learning can be broken down into regression and classification problems. With unsupervised learning, we do not have a clear dependent variable. We have a feature matrix of x variables and no y variable. Unsupervised learning problems can involve clustering and creating associations. I won’t get into clustering in this overview, but it’s a great skillset to learn. Additionally, unsupervised learning can be beneficial from a data exploration perspective.\n\nClassification or Regression: Now that we know we have a supervised learning problem, we can decide whether it is a classification or regression problem. I look at the y variable and determine if that variable is a continuous or discrete variable. Categorical y variables fall into the classification setting whereas continuous quantitative variables fall into the regression setting. An example of a classification problem would be determining where or not a credit card transaction is fraudulent. This is a binary classification problem because each transaction is either fraudulent or not fraudulent. The classic example of a regression problem is determining the price of a house based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and lot size.\n\nPrediction or Inference: In a prediction setting, we want our model to estimate a y value, given a variety of features. From our regression example above, we would want to feed our model a house that has 1,500 square feet, 2 bedrooms, and a 0.50 acre lot. Our model would then predict that the house was worth $200,000. In an inference setting, we want to know how a feature (x variable) affects the output (y variable). We could see how the price of a house increases when you add an additional bedroom to the house.\n\nThese three sets of questions can offer a lot of guidance when solving your data science problem.\n\nIn our example, we are going to be using regression (supervised learning) to predict IMDB rating from Metacritic Ratings, Budgets, Runtime, and Votes.\n\nBack to the coding part! Let’s determine which variable is our target and which features we think are important.\n\nOur target is going to be the column titled Rating and our features are going to be the columns titled the following: MetaCritic, Budget, Runtime, VotesUS, VotesnUS, and TotalVotes. I will remove all of the columns we don’t need for this analysis.\n\ndf = df[['Title', 'Rating', 'TotalVotes', 'MetaCritic', 'Budget', 'Runtime', 'VotesUS', 'VotesnUS']]\n\nPandas and Matplotlib (a popular Python plotting library) are going to assist in the majority of our exploration. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) gives the data scientist an opportunity to really learn about the data he or she is working with. Many data scientists find themselves coming back to EDA and the findings he or she found in EDA later on in the process.\n\nThroughout the EDA process, I clean the data. Data from the real world is very messy. But as I work through the EDA process and learn about the data, I take notes on things I need to fix in order to conduct my analysis. Data cleaning and EDA go hand in hand for me. I work between the two for a sizeable amount of time and I often find myself coming back to these stages.\n\nThe first thing I check is data types. Getting all of the values in the correct format is important. This can involve stripping characters from strings, converting integers to floats, or many other things.\n\ndf.dtypes\n\ndf.TotalVotes = df.TotalVotes.str.replace(',', '')\n\ndf.TotalVotes = df.TotalVotes.astype(int)\n\n# Total Votes column is ready.\n\ndf = df[(df.Budget.str.contains(\"Opening\") == False) &amp; (df.Budget.str.contains(\"Pathé\") == False)]\n\ndf.Budget = df.Budget.str.replace('[^\\x00-\\x7F]','')\n\ndf.Budget = df.Budget.str.replace(',', '')\n\ndf.Budget = df.Budget.str.replace('$', '')\n\ndf.Budget = df.Budget.astype(int)\n\n# Budget column is ready.\n\ndf.Runtime = df.Runtime.str.extract('(\\d+)', expand=False)\n\n# Runtime column is now ready.\n\nMissing values and null values are common. Sometimes you have very large matrices with little information in them. These are known as sparse matrices. Handling missing and null values is a whole topic in itself. This topic is known as missing data imputation and I can’t get into it here. Be sure to look up more information on this topic, especially if you run into sparse matrices. For our purposes, I am going to simply drop the movies with null values. This isn’t always the best idea, but I have elected to do so in this analysis.\n\ndf = df.dropna()\n\ndf.Runtime = df.Runtime.astype(int)\n\ndf.VotesnUS = df.VotesnUS.astype(float)\n\ndf.VotesUS = df.VotesUS.astype(float)\n\nThere are many different ways you can conduct EDA with Pandas on your data. Checking missing values, checking data types, and formatting the data are only the tip of the iceberg. Look for the number of unique values. Use the Pandas describe method to get summary statistics on your columns. Pandas is a very useful tool at this stage of the data analysis process and becoming familiar with data cleaning with Pandas is an essential tool for any data scientist.\n\nThe last part of EDA is plotting. Plotting is very important because it allows you to visually inspect your data. Histograms, scatter matrices, and box plots can all be used to offer another layer of insight into your data problem. For this example, we will use Pandas to create a scatter matrix.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\npd.plotting.scatter_matrix(df, figsize=(20,20))\n\nplt.show()\n\nIn the data exploration and cleaning phase, I also perform feature engineering. Feature engineering is the construction of new features from old features. Some basic types of feature engineering would be to create interaction variables from two features or to create lagged variables for time series analysis. Feature engineering is another topic I am going to brush over in this workflow but it shouldn’t be forgotten.\n\n4) Baseline Modeling\n\nAs a data scientist, you will build a lot of models. You will use a variety of algorithms to perform a wide variety of tasks. You will need to use intuition and experience to decide when certain models are appropriate. As an economist by trade, I prefer to begin with linear regression for my regression problems and logistic regression for my classification problems. (I also tend to use kNN for baseline classification models and K-Means as my first clustering algorithm in unsupervised learning.) These models will give you a baseline upon which you can improve.\n\nIn Kaggle competitions, many of the winners use advanced neural networks, XGBoost, or Random Forests to solve data science problems. All of these will come later and should get us more accurate predictions than linear and logistic regressions.\n\nScikit-Learn is a machine learning package for Python that can be used for a variety of tasks. We can use Scikit-Learn for modeling (classification, regression, and clustering). It can also be used for dimensionality reduction (Principal Component Analysis), model selection (grid search, evaluation metrics), and preprocessing data. The basics of modeling are similar across different algorithms when you are working within Scikit-Learn.\n\nDuring model preprocessing we are going to separate out our features from our dependent variables, scale the data across the board, and use a train-test-split to prevent overfitting of our model. Overfitting is when our model too closely tracks our training data and when it is fed new data, it doesn’t perform well. This means the model won’t generalize well to new problems. The model is picking up all of the noise in the training data and memorizing it. Creating a training-test-split helps to combat overfitting. Additionally, we could use Cross Validation to prevent overfitting. Be sure to look up more about cross validation on your own.\n\ny = df.Rating\n\nX = df[['TotalVotes', 'MetaCritic', 'Budget', 'Runtime', 'VotesUS', 'VotesnUS']]\n\n# We need to separate our feature matrix from our y variable for Sklearn.\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n\ncor_X = MinMaxScaler().fit_transform(X)\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(cor_X, y, test_size=0.2)\n\nprint (X_train.shape, y_train.shape)\n\nprint (X_test.shape, y_test.shape)\n\nNow we are ready to use our model. We are going to fit our model on the training data. Then we are going to test our model by having it predict y values for our X_test data. We can then evaluate how well our model performed by seeing how far off the predicted y values were from the actual y values.\n\nfrom sklearn import linear_model\n\nlm = linear_model.LinearRegression()\n\nmodel = lm.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\npredictions = lm.predict(X_test)\n\nplt.scatter(y_test, predictions)\n\nplt.xlabel('True y')\n\nplt.ylabel('Predicted y')\n\nplt.show()\n\n# Graph\n\nprint ('Score:', model.score(X_test, y_test)) # R-squared is the default metric used by Sklearn.\n\nOur model performed pretty well. It was able to reach an R-squared of 0.96. This evaluation metric, R-squared, is a goodness-of-fit metric. It is the percentage of variation in our y variable explained by our model. For this regression problem, we could also have evaluated our model with Root Mean Squared Error and Adjusted R-squared.\n\nModel evaluation metrics are numerous. For classification problems, common evaluation metrics are accuracy and ROC-AUC scores. Evaluating your model is very important and learning more about the evaluation metrics is wise.\n\nOverall, I would use caution with these results. The features we have selected are likely collinear. Basically, collinearity is when you have features that are very similar or are giving us the same information about the dependent variable. The classic example of collinearity (perfect collinearity) is a feature that gives us a temperature in Celsius and another that reports Fahrenheit. One of these variables would be redundant. The features VotesUS and VotesnUS (votes non-US) could be very related. This could be a reason why we have such a high R-squared value. Luckily, we will use a non-parametric algorithm in Part 5.\n\nThere are a few ways we could combat collinearity and the most basic of them would be to drop one of the Votes variables. There are other methods, like proxy variables, we could use to solve this collinearity problem. But we won’t get into those here (I seem to say that often).\n\nlm.coef_\n\nBefore moving on to other models, I want to bring up the beta coefficients from our linear model. We see that the Votes outside the US had the largest positive impact on the IMDB rating. This form of inference is probably not a great idea because we don’t know if these coefficients are statistically significant or not. If you were trying to solve a regression inference problem, I would recommend using the Python library Statsmodels. The output from Statsmodels is an ANOVA table plus the coefficients and their associated p-values.\n\n5) Secondary Modeling\n\nYou can build hundreds of models and I have had friends model build and model tune for exorbitant amounts of time (cough_Costa_cough). Instead of going into every single regression model you could use in this scenario, I am going to use a Kaggle favorite, Random Forests. The Random Forests model is an ensemble model that uses many decision trees to classify or regress. The training algorithm uses bagging, which is a combination of bootstrap and aggregating. The Random Forest algorithm also has the benefit of being non-parametric. Since this isn’t a model tutorial (which may be fun to make), I am not going to get into specifics of this algorithm. Let’s just see how to use it in Scikit-Learn.\n\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n\nrf = RandomForestRegressor()\n\nmodel = rf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\npredictions = rf.predict(X_test)\n\nprint ('Score:', model.score(X_test, y_test)) # R-square is still the default for Sklearn.\n\nmodel.feature_importances_\n\nWhoa! Our Random Forest model did worse than our linear regression model. That’s a surprising result. That shows us the power of simple, easy-to-understand models like linear regression. If we look at the feature importance, we can see this Random Forest model agrees with our linear regression model that Votes outside the US matter a lot in predicting IMDB ratings. Our dataset is pretty small so this odd result could be a product of the small dataset.\n\nAlternatively, we have mentioned that our linear regression may suffer from high collinearity. In this scenario, I would trust the results of the random forest model over that of the linear regression because of this collinearity problem.\n\nNow there is a whole rabbit-hole of parameter tuning we could go down. Each algorithm is going to have a set of parameters you can optimize. With our Random Forest Model, I often experiment with the max depth and the learning rate. But as you can tell, these parameters are specific to your modeling algorithm so I won’t get into it here. I will mention Grid Search. Grid search allows you to vary the parameters in your model (thus creating multiple models), train those models, and evaluate each model using cross validation. Scikit-Learn has a GridSearchCV for this. When you decide to tune multiple parameters at one time, it may be beneficial to use grid search.\n\nWhat now?\n\nPhoto by energepic.com from Pexels https://www.pexels.com/photo/architect-composition-data-demonstration-313691/\n\n6) Communicating Results\n\nIn my mind there are two directions your data science project can go: the data science product and the data science report.\n\nFirst, you can create a data science product. Getting your model into production is, once again, a topic in itself. To begin with, you will need to move code from your Jupyter Notebook to scripts. In most firms, the data scientist will be working along side the software engineering team to write this code. The model will first need to be pickled and this can be accomplished with Scikit-Learn’s Joblib. Then we can use Flask and Heroku to create an application for your model. In this tutorial, I have elected to forgo this method. Developing data science products is a very useful skill and I myself am diving deeper into these processes. I encourage you to do the same!\n\nAlternatively to the data product, you can create a data science report. You can showcase your results to the firm with a presentation and offer a technical overview on the process. Remember to keep your audience in mind. If you are presenting results to a room full of data scientists, go into detail. If you are advising the sales team, don’t talk about the universal approximation theorem for 45 minutes before explaining your results. To me, a data science report is a bit like a mini thesis. You are presenting a paper, which your peers (and bosses) will scrutinize and which you need to defend.\n\nIf your company allows you to publish the results, I would recommend bringing your presentation to a data science meetup. Feedback on your project for the data science community at large is always a great learning experience. Check out PyData videos on YouTube if you want to see some excellent presentations. Additionally, write a blog post and push your code to GitHub so the data science community can learn from your success. Communicating your results is a part of the scientific process so don’t keep your findings hidden away!\n\n7) Conclusion\n\nI hope this workflow and mini-project was helpful for aspiring data scientists and people who work with data scientists. Like I mentioned a million times, there is a lot of detail that I glossed over here. Let me know if you have any questions or comments!\n\n8) Resources\n\nIdea for the workflow came from William Wolf (Platzi.com) and Doing Data Science by Cathy O’Neil and Rachel Schutt.\n\nElements of Statistical Learning and Introduction to Statistical Learning are great texts that can offer more details about many of the topics I glossed over.\n\nh/t to Brice Wolfgang for editing."</span></span>,

      "<span class="hljs-attribute">full_text</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"Bounter -- Counter for large datasets\n\nBounter is a Python library, written in C, for extremely fast probabilistic counting of item frequencies in massive datasets, using only a small fixed memory footprint.\n\nWhy Bounter?\n\nBounter lets you count how many times an item appears, similar to Python's built-in dict or Counter :\n\nfrom bounter import bounter counts = bounter( size_mb = 1024 ) # use at most 1 GB of RAM counts.update([ u ' a ' , ' few ' , u ' words ' , u ' a ' , u ' few ' , u ' times ' ]) # count item frequencies print (counts[ u ' few ' ]) # query the counts 2\n\nHowever, unlike dict or Counter , Bounter can process huge collections where the items would not even fit in RAM. This commonly happens in Machine Learning and NLP, with tasks like dictionary building or collocation detection that need to estimate counts of billions of items (token ngrams) for their statistical scoring and subsequent filtering.\n\nBounter implements approximative algorithms using optimized low-level C structures, to avoid the overhead of Python objects. It lets you specify the maximum amount of RAM you want to use. In the Wikipedia example below, Bounter uses 31x less memory compared to Counter .\n\nBounter is also marginally faster than the built-in dict and Counter , so wherever you can represent your items as strings (both byte-strings and unicode are fine, and Bounter works in both Python2 and Python3), there's no reason not to use Bounter instead.\n\nInstallation\n\nBounter has no dependencies beyond Python &gt;= 2.7 or Python &gt;= 3.3 and a C compiler:\n\npip install bounter # install from PyPI\n\nOr, if you prefer to install from the source tar.gz:\n\npython setup.py test # run unit tests python setup.py install\n\nHow does it work?\n\nNo magic, just some clever use of approximative algorithms and solid engineering.\n\nIn particular, Bounter implements three different algorithms under the hood, depending on what type of \"counting\" you need:\n\nCardinality estimation: \"How many unique items are there?\"\n\nfrom bounter import bounter counts = bounter( need_counts = False ) counts.update([ ' a ' , ' b ' , ' c ' , ' a ' , ' b ' ]) print (counts.cardinality()) # cardinality estimation 3 print (counts.total()) # efficiently accumulates counts across all items 5\n\nThis is the simplest use case and needs the least amount of memory, by using the HyperLogLog algorithm (built on top of Joshua Andersen's HLL code).\n\nItem frequencies: \"How many times did this item appear?\"\n\nfrom bounter import bounter counts = bounter( need_iteration = False , size_mb = 200 ) counts.update([ ' a ' , ' b ' , ' c ' , ' a ' , ' b ' ]) print (counts.total(), counts.cardinality()) # total and cardinality still work ( 5 L , 3 L ) print (counts[ ' a ' ]) # supports asking for counts of individual items 2\n\nThis uses the Count-min Sketch algorithm to estimate item counts efficiently, in a fixed amount of memory. See the API docs for full details and parameters.\n\nAs a further optimization, Count-min Sketch optionally support a logarithmic probabilistic counter:\n\nbounter(need_iteration=False) : default option. Exact counter, no probabilistic counting. Occupies 4 bytes (max value 2^32) per bucket.\n\n: default option. Exact counter, no probabilistic counting. Occupies 4 bytes (max value 2^32) per bucket. bounter(need_iteration=False, log_counting=1024) : an integer counter that occupies 2 bytes. Values up to 2048 are exact; larger values are off by +/- 2%. The maximum representable value is around 2^71.\n\n: an integer counter that occupies 2 bytes. Values up to 2048 are exact; larger values are off by +/- 2%. The maximum representable value is around 2^71. bounter(need_iteration=False, log_counting=8) : a more aggressive probabilistic counter that fits into just 1 byte. Values up to 8 are exact and larger values can be off by +/- 30%. The maximum representable value is about 2^33.\n\nSuch memory vs. accuracy tradeoffs are sometimes desirable in NLP, where being able to handle very large collections is more important than whether an event occurs exactly 55,482x or 55,519x.\n\nFull item iteration: \"What are the items and their frequencies?\"\n\nfrom bounter import bounter counts = bounter( size_mb = 200 ) # default version, unless you specify need_items or need_counts counts.update([ ' a ' , ' b ' , ' c ' , ' a ' , ' b ' ]) print (counts.total(), counts.cardinality()) # total and cardinality still work ( 5 L , 3 ) print (counts[ ' a ' ]) # individual item frequency still works 2 print ( list (counts)) # iterator returns keys, just like Counter [ u ' b ' , u ' a ' , u ' c ' ] print ( list (counts.iteritems())) # supports iterating over key-count pairs, etc. [( u ' b ' , 2 L ), ( u ' a ' , 2 L ), ( u ' c ' , 1 L )]\n\nStores the keys (strings) themselves in addition to the total cardinality and individual item frequency (8 bytes). Uses the most memory, but supports the widest range of functionality.\n\nThis option uses a custom C hash table underneath, with optimized string storage. It will remove its low-count objects when nearing the maximum alotted memory, instead of expanding the table.\n\nFor more details, see the API docstrings.\n\nExample on the English Wikipedia\n\nLet's count the frequencies of all bigrams in the English Wikipedia corpus:\n\nwith smart_open( ' wikipedia_tokens.txt.gz ' ) as wiki: for line in wiki: words = line.decode().split() bigrams = zip (words, words[ 1 :]) counter.update( u ' ' .join(pair) for pair in bigrams) print (counter[ u ' czech republic ' ]) 42099\n\nThe Wikipedia dataset contained 7,661,318 distinct words across 1,860,927,726 total words, and 179,413,989 distinct bigrams across 1,857,420,106 total bigrams. Storing them in a naive built-in dict would consume over 31 GB RAM.\n\nTo test the accuracy of Bounter, we automatically extracted collocations (common multi-word expressions, such as \"New York\", \"network license\", \"Supreme Court\" or \"elementary school\") from these bigram counts.\n\nWe compared the set of collocations extracted from Counter (exact counts, needs lots of memory) vs Bounter (approximate counts, bounded memory) and present the precision and recall here:\n\nAlgorithm Time to build Memory Precision Recall F1 score Counter (built-in) 32m 26s 31 GB 100% 100% 100% bounter(size_mb=128, need_iteration=False, log_counting=8) 19m 53s 128 MB 95.02% 97.10% 96.04% bounter(size_mb=1024) 17m 54s 1 GB 100% 99.27% 99.64% bounter(size_mb=1024, need_iteration=False) 19m 58s 1 GB 99.64% 100% 99.82% bounter(size_mb=1024, need_iteration=False, log_counting=1024) 20m 05s 1 GB 100% 100% 100% bounter(size_mb=1024, need_iteration=False, log_counting=8) 19m 59s 1 GB 97.45% 97.45% 97.45% bounter(size_mb=4096) 16m 21s 4 GB 100% 100% 100% bounter(size_mb=4096, need_iteration=False) 20m 14s 4 GB 100% 100% 100% bounter(size_mb=4096, need_iteration=False, log_counting=1024) 20m 14s 4 GB 100% 99.64% 99.82%\n\nBounter achieves a perfect F1 score of 100% at 31x less memory (1GB vs 31GB), compared to a built-in Counter or dict . It is also 61% faster.\n\nEven with just 128 MB (250x less memory), its F1 score is still 96.04%.\n\nSupport\n\nUse Github issues to report bugs, and our mailing list for general discussion and feature ideas.\n\nBounter is open source software released under the MIT license.\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 RaRe Technologies"</span></span>,

Without having to first download the sample code, its runtime, and configure your environment so that everything is setup the way you need it? What if you could be reading a book, and immediately execute (and change!) the code without needing to install anything on your computer? What if you could do this without needing any software other than a modern web browser?\n\nAzure Notebooks makes it easy to read a book online and run and change the code samples all from just a modern web browser. Today, we’re delighted to announce that Jake VanderPlas’ Python Data Science Handbook is now available for free on Azure notebooks.\n\nThe book is published by O’Reilly as well as in Jupyter notebook format. We are hosting the complete book on Azure Notebooks. You can learn the fundamentals of Data Science by either purchasing the book, or by hopping over to Azure and cloning your own copy and “running” it.\n\nI personally like the feel of an actual book, and now with the ability to run the book without preparing an environment or installing software; the whole experience is a lot more enjoyable.\n\nNote that the Jupyter version of the book is not just the code, but the entire prose as well.\n\nWhat’s Azure Notebooks?\n\nAzure Notebooks is free service for hosting and running Jupyter notebooks. Let’s take a look at Jupyter itself first.\n\nJupyter is an open source project started by Professors Fernando Perez and Brian Granger that provides a rich, browser-based notebook for general data analysis and exploration. Jupyter notebooks are comprised of markdown, executable code, interactive plots and much more.\n\nImagine your typical scientific paper in static PDF format, except now the code is executable, plots are interactive, and notebooks can be shared easily for reproducibility – that’s what Jupyter notebooks enable.\n\nAzure Notebooks provides a playground to create, run, and share Jupyter notebooks for free. Python 2, Python 3, R and F# are currently supported. Beyond languages, you get their supporting distros, such as Anaconda which provides access to 500+ pkgs for just about any domain.\n\nTypical scenario for using Azure Notebooks\n\nThis O’Reilly title is our first foray into “Executable” books. We hope that it becomes a trend and a convenient (and fun!) way for people to explore books. There are near-infinite possibilities for how you can use Azure Notebooks:\n\nLearn a programming language (check out the samples on our homepage)\n\nUniversity courses (checkout out this sample from Georgia Tech)\n\nGive a webinar/seminar/talk to 500+ people (w/o any software installation headaches)\n\nExplore Azure (check out the CosmosDB sample running against a live database)\n\nPython Data Science Handbook contents\n\nBeyond Data Science, Jake’s book is packed with excellent introductions to Python and Jupyter itself. All the Jupyter material applies to Azure Notebooks as well\n\nChapter 1: IPython: Beyond Normal Python\n\nChapter 2: Introduction to NumPy\n\nChapter 3: Data Manipulation with Pandas\n\nChapter 4: Visualization with Matplotlib\n\nChapter 5: Machine Learning\n\nWhile on Azure notebooks, you can view an HTML preview of the book without logging in. If you want to run/edit the book, you need to sign in and “clone” the book, which gives you your own private copy to execute and edit.\n\nSummary\n\nThanks to Jake and O’Reilly, we’re at an exciting juncture for learning and exploration using executable books. We’re delighted to partner with O’Reilly on this journey and hope to provide access to other books in the future.\n\nLinks:"</span></span>,

As Southwest, Amazon, FedEx, and UPS have demonstrated, to remain viable, industries that are asset-intensive and service-based must streamline operations and do more with less. Health care providers can’t keep spending their way out of trouble by investing in more and more infrastructure; instead, they must optimize their use of the assets currently in place. To do this, providers need to consistently make excellent operational decisions, as these other industries have. Ultimately, they need to create an operational “air traffic control” for their hospitals — a centralized command-and-control capability that is predictive, learns continually, and uses optimization algorithms and artificial intelligence to deliver prescriptive recommendations throughout the system. Dozens of healthcare organizations are now streamlining operations by using platforms from providers including LeanTaaS, Intelligent InSites, Qgenda, Optum, and IBM Watson Health. What these solutions have in common is the ability to mine and process large quantities of data to deliver recommendations to administrative and clinical end users. Used correctly, analytics tools can lower health care costs, reduce wait times, increase patient access, and unlock capacity with the infrastructure that’s already in place.\n\nkatyau/Getty Images\n\nAirlines are arguably more operationally complex, asset-intensive, and regulated than hospitals, yet the best performers are doing a better job by far than most hospitals at keeping costs low and make a decent profit while delivering what their customers expect. Southwest Airlines, for example, has figured out how to do well the two operational things that matter most: Keep more planes in the sky more often, and fill each of them up more, and more often, than anyone else. Similarly, winners in other complex, asset-intensive, service-based industries — Amazon, well-run airports, UPS, and FedEx — have figured out how to over-deliver on their promise while staying streamlined and affordable.\n\nThese examples are relevant to health care for two reasons.\n\nFirst, hospital operations are in many ways like airline and airport operations and transportation services. There are many steps in the service operation (check-in, baggage, the security line, gates), high variability at each step (weather delays, congestion, mechanical issues), multiple connected segments in the user journey — and all these operations involve people, not just machines. In mathematical terms, hospital operations, like airlines and transportation, consist of hundreds of mini-processes, each of which is more stochastic and less deterministic than, say, the steps in assembling a car.\n\nAnd second, hospitals today face the same cost and revenue pressure that retail, transportation, and airlines have faced for years. As Southwest, Amazon, FedEx, and UPS have demonstrated, to remain viable, industries that are asset-intensive and service-based must streamline operations and do more with less. Health care providers can’t keep spending their way out of trouble by investing in more and more infrastructure; instead, they must optimize their use of the assets currently in place.\n\nInsight Center Transforming Health Care Sponsored by Medtronic How leading providers are delivering value for patients.\n\nTo do this, providers need to consistently make excellent operational decisions, as these other industries have. Ultimately, they need to create an operational “air traffic control” for their hospitals — a centralized command-and-control capability that is predictive, learns continually, and uses optimization algorithms and artificial intelligence to deliver prescriptive recommendations throughout the system.

What these solutions have in common is the ability to mine and process large quantities of data to deliver recommendations to administrative and clinical end users.\n\nImproving hospital operational efficiency through data science boils down to applying predictive analytics to improve planning and execution of key care-delivery processes, chief among them resource utilization (including infusion chairs, operating rooms, imaging equipment, and inpatient beds), staff schedules, and patient admittance and discharge. When this is done right, providers see an increase in patient access (accommodation of more patients, sooner) and revenue, lower cost, increased asset utilization, and an improved patient experience. Here are a few examples:\n\nIncreasing OR utilization. For a resource that brings in more than 60% of admissions and 65% of revenue at most hospitals, current block-scheduling techniques fall far short in optimizing operating-room time and in improving patient access, surgeon satisfaction, and care quality. Current techniques — phone calls, faxes, and emails — make block-schedule changes cumbersome, error prone, and slow. Using predictive analytics, mobile technologies, and cloud computing, providers are mining utilization patterns to dramatically improve OR scheduling.\n\nFor example, mobile apps now allow surgeons and their schedulers to request the block time they need with one click. At UCHealth in Colorado, scheduling apps allow patients to get treated faster (surgeons release their unneeded blocks 10% sooner than with manual techniques), surgeons gain better control and access (the median number of blocks released by surgeon per month has increased by 47%), and overall utilization (and revenue) increases. With these tools, UCHealth increased per-OR revenue by 4%, which translates into an additional $15 million in revenue annually.\n\nSlashing infusion center wait times. Infusion scheduling is an extremely complex mathematical problem. Even for a 30-chair center, avoiding the 10 AM to 2 PM “rush hour” in a patient-centric way requires picking one of a googol (10100 ) of possible solutions. Faced with this challenge, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital applied predictive analytics and machine learning to optimize its schedule templates, resulting in a 50% drop in patient wait times. In addition to improving longer-term patient scheduling, these technologies help schedulers manage an infusion center’s day-to-day uncertainty — last-minute add-ons, late cancellations, and no-shows — as well as optimize nurses’ workloads and the timing of breaks.\n\nStreamlining ED operations. Emergency departments are famous for bottlenecks, whether because patients are waiting for lab results or imaging backed up in queues or because the department is understaffed. Analytics-driven software that can determining the most efficient order of ED activities, dramatically reducing patient wait times. When a new patient needs an X-ray and a blood draw, knowing the most efficient sequence can save patients time and make smarter use of ED resources. Software can now reveal historic holdups (maybe there’s a repeated Wednesday EKG staffing crunch that needs fixing) and show providers in real time each patient’s journey through the department and wait times. This allows providers to eliminate recurring bottlenecks and call for staff or immediately reroute patient traffic to improve efficiency. Emory University Hospital, for example, used predictive analytics to forecast patient demand for each category of lab test by time of day and day of week. In so doing, the provider reduced average patient wait times from one hour to 15 minutes, which reduced ED bottlenecks proportionally.\n\nED to inpatient-bed transfer. Predictive tools can also allow providers to forecast the likelihood that a patient will need to be admitted, and provide an immediate estimate of which unit or units can accommodate them. With this information, the hospitalist and ED physician can quickly agree on a likely onboarding flow, which can be made visible to everyone across the onboarding chain. This data-driven approach also helps providers prioritize which beds should be cleaned first, which units should accelerate discharge, and which patients should be moved to a discharge lounge. Using a centralized, data-driven patient logistics system, Sharp HealthCare in San Diego reduced its admit order-to-occupy time by more three hours.\n\nAccelerated discharge planning. To optimize discharge planning, case managers and social workers need to be able to foresee and prevent discharge delays. Electronic health records or other internal system often gather data on “avoidable discharge delays” — patients who in the last month, quarter, or year were delayed because of insurance verification problems or lack of transportation, destination, or post-discharge care. This data is a gold mine for providers; with the proper analytics tools, within an hour of a patient arriving and completing their paperwork, a provider can predict with fairly high accuracy who among its hundreds of patients is most likely to run into trouble during discharge. By using such tools, case managers and social workers can create a shortlist of high-priority patients whose discharge planning they can start as soon as the patient is admitted. Using discharge analytics software, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, DC, for example, increased its daily discharge volume by 21%, reduced length of stay by half a day, and increased morning discharges to 24% of all daily discharges.\n\nMaking excellent operational decisions consistently, hundreds of times per day, demands sophisticated data science. Used correctly, analytics tools can lower health care costs, reduce wait times, increase patient access, and unlock capacity with the infrastructure that’s already in place."</span></span>,

      "<span class="hljs-attribute">full_text</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"With the abundance of deep learning frameworks available today, it can be difficult to know what to choose for any particular application. Given the contrasting strengths and weaknesses of these frameworks, the ability to work with and switch between more than one is particularly important. Recent Cloudera blogs have shown how examples of applying deep learning on the Cloudera ecosystem using popular frameworks Deeplearning4j, BigDL, and Keras+TensorFlow. This post extends those examples by providing details on performing image recognition with convolutional neural networks using the Apache MXNet (incubating) framework, leveraging Cloudera’s Data Science Workbench for an interactive development environment.\n\nThe MXNet Python interface was easy to learn, in large part because of its dynamic computation model that is familiar to anyone with traditional Python experience. The performance and scaling of MXNet was on par with other GPU accelerated frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, and the ability to easily add multiple GPUs for linear speedups in computation time was a big win.\n\nApache MXNet\n\nMXNet is now an Apache incubator project, but originally came out of the Distributed Machine Learning Common (DMLC) initiative. It has an efficient backend implementation written in C++, but supports many different API languages including Python, R, and Scala. It is a full-featured deep learning framework, that supports multi-GPU and distributed training.\n\nMost every framework has strengths and weaknesses: TensorFlow and Caffe are great for model deployment and productionizing, while PyTorch excels during the model building and research phases. MXNet, short for “mix-net,” intends to combine the strengths of a few different approaches to deep learning in a single framework. One of the original goals of the project was to provide both imperative and declarative – the tradeoffs of which are discussed later in this post – approaches to deep learning, giving users the options to choose. This is further reinforced by the recent release of the MXNet Gluon API, which allows seamless switching between static and dynamic computation graphs for deep learning models. The ability to use both static and dynamic computation models for deep learning make MXNet a good choice for both building custom, modular algorithms as well as deploying fast, optimized networks in the production phase.\n\nImage Classification via Transfer Learning\n\nRecent Cloudera blogs have already demonstrated the concept of using pre-trained image classification models to achieve state-of-the-art results on other datasets. Those examples used distributed computation frameworks like Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop to distribute the heavy computation among processing cores of CPUs across a cluster of machines. This example instead explores using GPUs on a cluster edge node using a Python environment on the Cloudera Data Science Workbench.\n\nThe goal of this post is to perform image classification on the Caltech-256 dataset, predicting the label of each image from one of 257 different possibilities. Instead of training a deep neural network from scratch on this data, it is generally a best practice to leverage pre-trained neural networks – in this case, networks that were trained on the popular ImageNet dataset – and transfer their learned weights to this task.\n\nThe first step in transfer learning with images is to “featurize” them, or to pass the images through a portion of the pretrained model to extract higher-level visual features about the images. The Gluon API provides an easy way to pull popular image recognition models from the MXNet “model zoo.”\n\ndevices = [mx.gpu(i) for i in range(num_gpus)] vgg16 = gluon.model_zoo.vision.vgg16(pretrained=True, ctx=devices) 1 2 devices = [ mx . gpu ( i ) for i in range ( num_gpus ) ] vgg16 = gluon . model_zoo . vision . vgg16 ( pretrained = True , ctx = devices )\n\nThe code above pulls the model structure and model weights from a remote repository, and loads the parameters onto the devices specified in the ctx argument.

For the featurization step, the features section will be used with pretrained weights to generate the features for each image. Reading the images is easy using Gluon’s built-in dataset and loading tools.\n\nphases = ['train', 'test', 'valid'] datasets = {phase: gluon.data.vision.ImageFolderDataset(data_dir + '256_ObjectCategories/' + phase, flag=1, transform=image_transform) for phase in phases} loaders = {phase: gluon.data.DataLoader(datasets[phase], batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False) for phase in phases} 1 2 3 phases = [ 'train' , 'test' , 'valid' ] datasets = { phase : gluon . data . vision . ImageFolderDataset ( data_dir + '256_ObjectCategories/' + phase , flag = 1 , transform = image_transform ) for phase in phases } loaders = { phase : gluon . data . DataLoader ( datasets [ phase ] , batch_size = batch_size , shuffle = False ) for phase in phases }\n\nA dataset of images and a model loaded in the session is all that’s needed to start exploring some of the neat aspects of the Gluon framework. Gluon allows users to switch seamlessly between the dynamic graph (“define-by-run”) and the static graph (“define-then-run”) computation models. The dynamic graph model of PyTorch is generally more intuitive and easy to work with since it is closer to traditional programming, where users can view the outputs as lines of code are executed. The drawback of this approach is that it sacrifices performance enhancements available when compiling the program all at once, before execution.\n\nThe loaded model can be used as a dynamic graph by default, and can be used to check that a sample batch passes successfully through the network.\n\n&gt; first_data, first_label = next(iter(loaders['valid'])) &gt; vgg16_feat.forward(first_data.as_in_context(mx.gpu())) ... &lt;NDArray 32x512x7x7 @gpu(0)&gt; 1 2 3 4 &gt; first_data , first_label = next ( iter ( loaders [ 'valid' ] ) ) &gt; vgg16_feat . forward ( first_data . as_in_context ( mx . gpu ( ) ) ) . . . &lt; NDArray 32x512x7x7 @ gpu ( 0 ) &gt;\n\nThe output of the forward pass in this case is an actual NDArray that can be used just like traditional NumPy arrays. The advantage of this is that it makes control flow, looping, and experimentation easier and there is less overhead to learning this paradigm since it feels like NumPy. Still, in the style of TensorFlow it is possible to compile the computation graph and use it as a “define-then-run” program.\n\nIn this case there is no real need for the dynamic graph approach since featurization just involves taking an unchanging pre-trained model to compute the forward pass. To boost the performance, convert the model to a static graph using the hybridize method.\n\nAlso, be sure to check out the official Gluon documentation for fantastic tutorials, with code, exploring all sorts of useful deep learning concepts.\n\nImage Featurization\n\nThe below featurize method can be used to distribute data across multiple gpus, compute the forward pass through the model, and save it in MXNet’s efficient binary format, RecordIO.\n\ndef featurize(file_name, iterator): t0 = time.time() batches = [] for data, label in iterator: datas = gluon.utils.split_and_load(data, devs, even_split=False) labels = gluon.utils.split_and_load(label, devs, even_split=False) featurized = [(label, vgg16_feat.forward(data)) for label, data in zip(labels, datas)] batches.extend(featurized) write_batches(batches, file_name) print(\"Featurized %d images in %0.1f seconds.\" % (k, time.time() - t0)) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 def featurize ( file_name , iterator ) : t0 = time . time ( ) batches = [ ] for data , label in iterator : datas = gluon . utils . split_and_load ( data , devs , even_split = False ) labels = gluon . utils . split_and_load ( label , devs , even_split = False ) featurized = [ ( label , vgg16_feat . forward ( data ) ) for label , data in zip ( labels , datas ) ] batches . extend ( featurized ) write_batches ( batches , file_name ) print ( \"Featurized %d images in %0.1f seconds.\" % ( k , time . time ( ) - t0 ) )\n\nThe split_and_load utility function is used to split up each minibatch onto the GPUs available in the cluster. MXNet then passes each batch through a copy of the network that lives on each GPU, and finally writes those batches to disk on the local file system.\n\nKickoff the featurization step for each of the train/test/valid phases as below.\n\nfeaturize('data/train_feat', loaders['train']) featurize('data/valid_feat', loaders['valid']) featurize('data/test_feat', loaders['test']) 1 2 3 featurize ( 'data/train_feat' , loaders [ 'train' ] ) featurize ( 'data/valid_feat' , loaders [ 'valid' ] ) featurize ( 'data/test_feat' , loaders [ 'test' ] )\n\nAs this runs, it can be helpful to inspect the GPU utilization by opening a terminal session and executing the nvidia-smi command.\n\nThe output above indicates that two GPUs are currently being utilized to perform featurization for each batch in parallel. The featurization step is the most compute intensive part of the entire pipeline, including the training phase, because it amounts to a bunch of matrix computations that can be easily parallelized with relatively little communication overhead. Using the Workbench makes it trivial to add hardware during compute-intensive phases like featurization, but also free resources that aren’t needed during later phases (training, in this case). GPUs can be added to achieve near-linear speedups.\n\nThe ability to freely add and subtract resources, depending on the workload is particularly nice for deep learning applications since some stages of exploration/training require significantly more resources than others.\n\nMXNet with CDSW provides the tools to easily distribute heavy deep learning computations across multiple GPUs and/or CPUs, while the Gluon API serves as a flexible, easy-to-learn interface to the optimized MXNet backend.\n\nTraining\n\nNow that the images have been featurized, they are available in the data directory in the MXNet RecordIO format.\n\ndata - valid_feat.idx - test_feat.idx - train_feat.idx - valid_feat.rec - train_feat.rec - test_feat.rec 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 data - valid_feat . idx - test_feat . idx - train_feat . idx - valid_feat . rec - train_feat . rec - test_feat . rec\n\nBefore, the built-in ImageFolderDataset was used to read the JPEG files from disk, but in this case the format being read is RecordIO files, so a different approach is necessary.\n\nFortunately, it is possible to create a new type of dataset that extends the built-in RecordFileDataset that will read the binary format and convert the bytes back into the NDArray format needed for training. The full code for this new ArrayRecordDataset can be found here.\n\nFor the model, a reasonable starting point is to use the classifier section of the VGG16 model, but only train the final dense layer – leaving the other dense layers unchanged.\n\n&gt; vgg16.classifier HybridSequential( (0): Dense(4096, Activation(relu)) (1): Dropout(p = 0.5) (2): Dense(4096, Activation(relu)) (3): Dropout(p = 0.5) (4): Dense(1000, linear) ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 &gt; vgg16 . classifier HybridSequential ( ( 0 ) : Dense ( 4096 , Activation ( relu ) ) ( 1 ) : Dropout ( p = 0.5 ) ( 2 ) : Dense ( 4096 , Activation ( relu ) ) ( 3 ) : Dropout ( p = 0.5 ) ( 4 ) : Dense ( 1000 , linear ) )\n\nTwo things need to happen before training: the first two dense layer’s parameters must be “frozen” so that they are not changed during optimization and the last layer must be replaced with one that has 257 outputs, instead of the 1000 originally used for the ImageNet dataset. First, replace the final layer of the model:\n\nvgg16_cls = vgg16.classifier with vgg16_cls.name_scope(): vgg16_cls._children.pop() vgg16_cls.register_child(gluon.nn.Dense(257, prefix=\"predictions_\")) 1 2 3 4 vgg16_cls = vgg16 . classifier with vgg16_cls . name_scope ( ) : vgg16_cls . _children . pop ( ) vgg16_cls . register_child ( gluon . nn . Dense ( 257 , prefix = \"predictions_\" ) )\n\nWith the model layers correctly constructed, separate fixed and trainable parameters, and tell the MXNet engine that the backward pass is not required for fixed parameters.\n\ntrainable_params = gluon.parameter.ParameterDict() fixed_params = gluon.parameter.ParameterDict() for layer in vgg16_cls._children: if 'predictions' in layer.name: trainable_params.update(layer.collect_params()) else: fixed_params.update(layer.collect_params()) fixed_params.setattr('grad_req', 'null') 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 trainable_params = gluon . parameter . ParameterDict ( ) fixed_params = gluon . parameter . ParameterDict ( ) for layer in vgg16_cls . _children : if 'predictions' in layer . name : trainable_params . update ( layer . collect_params ( ) ) else : fixed_params . update ( layer . collect_params ( ) ) fixed_params . setattr ( 'grad_req' , 'null' )\n\nWhile other deep learning libraries like Keras provide a model.fit function (and in fact, the original MXNet API does as well) libraries like MXNet Gluon and PyTorch are designed to make it so easy to work with layers, tensors, and inputs/outputs that writing a fit function by hand is not much more than writing a simple Python for loop. Fitting a deep learning model usually just involves calling the forward and backward passes on the model, and then updating model parameters according to some flavor of stochastic gradient descent. An example of such a function is shown below.\n\ndef run(num_gpus, lr, num_epochs): # the list of GPUs that will be used ctx = [mx.gpu(i) for i in range(num_gpus)] print('Running on {}'.format(ctx)) train_data = loaders['train'] valid_data = loaders['valid'] print('Batch size is {}'.format(train_data._batch_sampler._batch_size)) trainable_params.initialize(ctx=ctx, force_reinit=True) trainer = gluon.Trainer(trainable_params, 'adam', {'learning_rate': lr}) for epoch in range(num_epochs): # train start = time.time() num_samples = 0 for data, label in train_data: num_samples += data.shape[0] train_batch(data, label, ctx, vgg16_cls, trainer) mx.nd.waitall() # wait until all computations are finished to benchmark the time print('Epoch %d, samples=%d, training time = %.1f sec' % (epoch, num_samples, time.time() - start)) # validation set correct, num = 0.0, 0.0 for data, label in valid_data: correct += valid_batch(data, label, ctx, vgg16_cls) num += data.shape[0] print(' validation accuracy = %.4f' % (correct / num)) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 def run ( num_gpus , lr , num_epochs ) : # the list of GPUs that will be used ctx = [ mx . gpu ( i ) for i in range ( num_gpus ) ] print ( 'Running on {}' . format ( ctx ) ) train_data = loaders [ 'train' ] valid_data = loaders [ 'valid' ] print ( 'Batch size is {}' . format ( train_data . _batch_sampler . _batch_size ) ) trainable_params . initialize ( ctx = ctx , force_reinit = True ) trainer = gluon . Trainer ( trainable_params , 'adam' , { 'learning_rate' : lr } ) for epoch in range ( num_epochs ) : # train start = time . time ( ) num_samples = 0 for data , label in train_data : num_samples += data . shape [ 0 ] train_batch ( data , label , ctx , vgg16_cls , trainer ) mx . nd . waitall ( ) # wait until all computations are finished to benchmark the time print ( 'Epoch %d, samples=%d, training time = %.1f sec' % ( epoch , num_samples , time . time ( ) - start ) ) # validation set correct , num = 0.0 , 0.0 for data , label in valid_data : correct += valid_batch ( data , label , ctx , vgg16_cls ) num += data . shape [ 0 ] print ( ' validation accuracy = %.4f' % ( correct / num ) )\n\nThe run function is responsible for initializing the parameters on the correct devices, and then running a configurable number of epochs for training. Each epoch consists of training on all mini-batches, and then displaying results of the evaluation of the new parameters on the validation set. An equivalent but simplified version of the train_batch function above is shown below.\n\ndef train_batch(data, label, network, trainer): loss = loss_function(network.forward(data), label) loss.backward() trainer.step(batch_size) 1 2 3 4 def train_batch ( data , label , network , trainer ) : loss = loss_function ( network . forward ( data ) , label ) loss . backward ( ) trainer . step ( batch_size )\n\nThat is basically all that is needed to build and train a deep learning model in MXNet Gluon! A call to the run function will kick off training on one or more GPUs (and CPUs if desired) and return an optimized model for image detection. For this task of object recognition on the Caltech-256 dataset, the Gluon model produces results in line with other frameworks and matches the state-of-the-art.\n\nConclusions\n\nApache MXNet is performant, versatile, and user-friendly\n\nMXNet proved to be another great tool for building deep learning applications, further improved through the release of the new Gluon API. Though MXNet provides many of the same features and interfaces as other open-source frameworks, it manages to stand out in several ways:\n\nIt provides an imperative interface for working with directly with tensors and layers that can leverage GPU acceleration. The dynamic graph framework that MXNet provides makes it easier to learn, since it feels like normal Python programming. It is easier to debug since the output can be inspected and validated at any point in the network. It is easier to create custom modules, when the need inevitably arises, because all of the building blocks are first-class citizens that users are already familiar with. Composing these into something custom feels almost as natural as using the standard tools. The ease-of-use of a dynamic framework lowers the overhead of new users of deep learning, which is crucially important at a time when deep learning has proven itself to be such an important differentiator in many industries and applications. MXNet allows users to choose between dynamic and static graphs. While dynamic graphs are superior for debugging and general intuition, static graphs can be optimized in ways that dynamic graphs cannot. MXNet Gluon provides the ability to choose the paradigm that best suits the needs of the users. MXNet provides APIs in several popular languages: Python, R, Scala, C++, Matlab, and others. The ability to choose between APIs in these languages is certainly convenient, but the Python API remains the main focus and other languages may lag behind. MXNet supports multi-gpu and multi-machine training, and boasts near-linear scaling across hundreds of machines. Any serious deep learning framework is going to support multi-gpu and multi-machine training now or in the future, but MXNet is on the bleeding edge here.\n\nBYODLF: Bring your own deep learning framework with CDSW\n\nWhile Apache MXNet is an exciting framework that seeks to combine the best of PyTorch and TensorFlow, it is one of just many popular and worthy deep learning frameworks available today. Working in the Cloudera data science workbench, deployed and integrated on top of the full suite of Cloudera tools, makes it easy to leverage any of these frameworks, and painless to switch between them when the need arises. In addition to this example using MXNet Gluon, the git repository for this blog also contains examples for Keras+TensorFlow and PyTorch.\n\nAll code used in this blog post can be found here. The examples are highly inspired by the MXNet Gluon documentation.\n\nNote: Cloudera Data Science Workbench is available to Cloudera customers who license Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub and Cloudera Data Engineering editions.

The source of confusion is the various definitions, business processes, value chain and evolving business models. Manufacturing, however, holds some of the most exciting developments in the Internet of Things and most economic benefit in terms of cost savings, new revenue streams and efficiency. The near term focus should be broader visibility of critical machine health through connectivity and reporting.\n\nBruce Sinclair's The IoT Inc Business Show podcast has a great interview in his Episode 64: IIoT Manufacturing From the Shop Floor to the Top Floor with Tanja Rueckert of SAP. An IoT enabled solution in connected manufacturing includes connectivity, intelligence, pattern analysis and ultimately, predictability. Predictive maintenance should be seen as predictive algorithms to extend the life of the machine akin to a doctor-patient relationship and lifetime extension. In assessing a patient, a doctor has to maintain a holistic view of health just as one would with IIoT. The true value will lie in an integrated end-to-end organization and each connected component is important and has an incremental IoT value. IIoT or connected manufacturing is literally \"connecting\" Operational Technology (OT) and Informational Technology (IT), meaning production and core business processes have end-to-end connectivity or what is known as visibility from the shop floor to the top floor. Tanja also sites machine learning algorithms and mapping back to core ERP systems to have a truly integrated value chain. Mass customization or individualized products with speed of production and delivery through automation and the integrated manufacturing system is another opportunity for differentiation. One can definitely see the value of SAP's core competencies being of significant value to larger manufacturing organizations and it was a fascinating discussion.\n\nIt verifies what I see and the business discussions I am having. The focus has been primarily on the first aspect, that is, connectivity and merging the operational technology with informational technology and analyzing the business processes in between. Predictive maintenance, condition monitoring and reliability are not new, but what is new is the connectivity and disseminating the information to a broader audience. The goal is to look for costly bad actors and systemic problems and then employ IIoT to improve efficiency. The connectivity, or as Tanja calls it, from shop floor to top floor is hitting the nail on the head -- having the operator's visibility extended to maintenance professionals where usage patterns and trends are analyzed to head off issues before they become costly problems or extending the life of the machine. For example, the sophisticated analysis on vibration of pump is reading thousands of readings per second now can be exported and shared with the right people. Incidences of the \"operator just shuts off the machine\" with potential machine errors times so many dollars per hour of downtime is not necessarily the right protocol as the operator is not a maintenance technician (often another company).

The source of confusion is the various definitions, business processes, value chain and evolving business models. Manufacturing, however, holds some of the most exciting developments in the Internet of Things and most economic benefit in terms of cost savings, new revenue streams and efficiency. The near term focus should be broader visibility of critical machine health through connectivity and reporting.\n\nBruce Sinclair's The IoT Inc Business Show podcast has a great interview in his Episode 64: IIoT Manufacturing From the Shop Floor to the Top Floor with Tanja Rueckert of SAP. An IoT enabled solution in connected manufacturing includes connectivity, intelligence, pattern analysis and ultimately, predictability. Predictive maintenance should be seen as predictive algorithms to extend the life of the machine akin to a doctor-patient relationship and lifetime extension. In assessing a patient, a doctor has to maintain a holistic view of health just as one would with IIoT. The true value will lie in an integrated end-to-end organization and each connected component is important and has an incremental IoT value. IIoT or connected manufacturing is literally \"connecting\" Operational Technology (OT) and Informational Technology (IT), meaning production and core business processes have end-to-end connectivity or what is known as visibility from the shop floor to the top floor. Tanja also sites machine learning algorithms and mapping back to core ERP systems to have a truly integrated value chain. Mass customization or individualized products with speed of production and delivery through automation and the integrated manufacturing system is another opportunity for differentiation. One can definitely see the value of SAP's core competencies being of significant value to larger manufacturing organizations and it was a fascinating discussion.\n\nIt verifies what I see and the business discussions I am having. The focus has been primarily on the first aspect, that is, connectivity and merging the operational technology with informational technology and analyzing the business processes in between. Predictive maintenance, condition monitoring and reliability are not new, but what is new is the connectivity and disseminating the information to a broader audience. The goal is to look for costly bad actors and systemic problems and then employ IIoT to improve efficiency. The connectivity, or as Tanja calls it, from shop floor to top floor is hitting the nail on the head -- having the operator's visibility extended to maintenance professionals where usage patterns and trends are analyzed to head off issues before they become costly problems or extending the life of the machine. For example, the sophisticated analysis on vibration of pump is reading thousands of readings per second now can be exported and shared with the right people. Incidences of the \"operator just shuts off the machine\" with potential machine errors times so many dollars per hour of downtime is not necessarily the right protocol as the operator is not a maintenance technician (often another company). The issue is compounded when the maintenance technician adds issues in a time-stamped queue instead of ranking things in a scale of importance.\n\nIIoT has the power to sift through this big data and identify trends for even more effective reliability than ever before. It is very encouraging and exciting to hear about the developments in the \"Fourth Industrial Revolution\"."</span></span>,

According to a study by IBM, by 2020 the number of annual job openings for all data savvy professionals in the United States will increase from 364,000 openings to 2,720,000. Furthermore, according to the study, the annual demand for the fast-growing new roles of data scientist, data developers, and data engineers will reach nearly 700,000 openings by 2020.\n\nMany companies find themselves searching for qualified candidates that can meet the business’s technical demands. However, just because a person technically fits the criteria, it does not necessarily mean they will make a strong team member. Human Resource directors should watch out for other traits in data scientists as well.\n\nThough hiring data scientists can take time—it takes 53 days on average to fill an analytics manager position in professional services—it is worth finding a good fit. Here are five traits HR managers should look for when hiring a data scientist.\n\nSoftware company, SAS, surveyed data scientists to find out what made a good data scientist. The most dominant trait found was in a group with strong logic and analytical skills. Of those surveyed, 41 percent had these traits, making this the largest group.\n\nData scientists should have a technical bias, meaning they stick to the data instead of bringing emotion or gut feeling into an argument. This person must be able to speak clearly and explain concepts in an easy-to-digest manner since others on the team might not have a technical background.\n\nData scientists need not only to dissect and analyze data, but they also need to explain that data to non-technical team members. Qualified data scientists can look at data and essentially tell its story, explaining how the team collected the data, how they analyzed the findings, and what they predict will happen in the future.\n\nA data scientist that can effectively tell a data story to the rest of the team will be in high demand as big data becomes ever more vital to a company’s decision-making process.\n\nCrowdFlower surveyed a group of data scientists and found that the group is generally happy with their job."</span></span>,

      "<span class="hljs-attribute">domain</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"microsoft"</span></span>,
      "<span class="hljs-attribute">full_text</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"This post is authored by Xibin Gao, Data Scientist, Wei Guo, Data Scientist, Brad Severtson, Senior Content Developer, and Debraj GuhaThakurta, Senior Data Scientist Lead, at Microsoft\n\n\n\nWhat is TDSP\n\n\n\nImproving the efficiency of developing and deploying data science solutions requires an efficient process to complement the data platforms and data science tools that you use. Many enterprise data science teams today face challenges pertaining to standardization, collaboration and the use of appropriate DevOps practices when developing and deploying their advanced analytics solutions.\n\n\n\nWe developed and released the Team Data Science Process (TDSP), an open GitHub project, to address these very challenges. TDSP is currently helping numerous data science teams in Microsoft and at other organizations to standardize their data science projects, adopt collaborative development and DevOps practices. TDSP was first released at Ignite in September 2016.\n\n\n\nIn this blog post, we provide an overview of recent developments involving TDSP, including recent releases and how its adoption has gone since our first public release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Releases\n\n\n\nSince our 2016 launch, we’ve made the following updates to TDSP:\n\n\n\nStandardized Data Exploration and Reporting: IDEAR in Microsoft ML Server and Python\n\n\n\nStandardization of data science projects and their artifacts is an important goal and deliverable of TDSP. With that objective, the TDSP team released the IDEAR (Interactive Data Exploration and Reporting) utility in R in September 2016. IDEAR helps you to generate a standardized report for the data exploration/understanding phase of the TDSP lifecycle (see image above). Since then, we’ve released additional versions of IDEAR for Python 3 which can be run on a client machine or on Azure Notebook Services, and for Microsoft Machine Learning Server (formerly called Microsoft R Server, or MRS) for big data. These also include several new features related to analysis of missing data, clusters with mixed data types, etc. Here’s the link to the GitHub repository for IDEAR and also AMAR, our R utility for Automated Modeling and Reporting.\n\n\n\nEnd to End Spark v2.0 Walkthrough\n\n\n\nTo facilitate the development and deployment of end-to-end data science solutions, we’ve previously published many walkthroughs following the TDSP lifecycle and using a variety of Microsoft data platforms and analytics tools including Azure Machine Learning, HDInsight Spark, Azure Data Lake and Azure SQL Data Warehouse. Microsoft Azure released Spark 2.0 on HDInsight (Linux) as a service in September 2016. To jumpstart the use of Spark 2.0 on HDInsight for data science and machine learning, we released an end-to-end data science walkthrough using pySpark and MLlib. Here’s a link to the related GitHub repository.\n\n\n\nEnd to End SQL Server Tutorial with Python\n\n\n\nSQL Server 2017 with machine learning services was released earlier this year. It allows Python scripts to run within SQL Server or to be embedded in SQL scripts and be deployed as stored procedures. Data scientists can combine the power of SQL and Python and build end-to-end machine learning solutions with much greater ease. We released a Python walkthrough that demonstrates how to build machine learning solutions in SQL Server 2017 following the TDSP lifecycle.\n\n\n\nInstantiating the TDSP Template in Azure Machine Learning\n\n\n\nUp until now, it has not been possible to instantiate the TDSP structure and templates directly within a data science tool. We’ve now enabled instantiation of project structure and templates within Azure Machine Learning, providing the benefits of standardization to data science teams that are using Azure Machine Learning.\n\n\n\nTDSP Adoption\n\n\n\nTDSP has been adopted by many data science teams within Microsoft and externally by several other organizations. For instance, Microsoft Consulting Services and other similarly mature data science teams within our large data science community are currently using TDSP to execute and deliver their advanced analytics projects. Also, organizations, such as, BlueGranite and New Signature are actively using TDSP to deliver analytics solutions and workshops to their customers.\n\n\n\nBased on our customers’ experiences, one of the things we’ve discovered is that organizations looking to standardize on TDSP may need to take a step-wise approach towards adopting its various practices and components. Some features, such as the standardized project structure, document templates and artifacts, as well as version control can be adopted in earlier stages. Also, organizations starting with TDSP-provided templates and artifacts may want to customize certain aspects to ensure they fit the nature of the projects in their organization (for instance, scoping templates for a specific business vertical). TDSP provides the standardization and collaboration guidelines, structure and templates as a foundation, which can be adopted easily with appropriate customization and staging by different organizations, based on the maturity of their data science teams and nature of their projects.\n\n\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback on how TDSP can be further enhanced for your evolving needs in this space – you can send us your feedback and comments via the GitHub issues page for TDSP or in the comments section below.\n\n\n\nXibin, Wei, Brad and Debraj"</span></span>,

If \"Big Data\" is the product of the IOT, \"Data Science\" is it's soul.\n\n.\n\nLet's define our terms:\n\n.\n\nInternet of Things (IOT): equipping all physical and organic things in the world with identifying intelligent devices allowing the near real-time collecting and sharing of data between machines and humans. The IOT era has already begun, albeit in it's first primitive stage.\n\n.\n\nData Science: the analysis of data creation. May involve machine learning, algorithm design, computer science, modeling, statistics, analytics, math, artificial intelligence and business strategy.\n\n.\n\nBig Data: the collection, storage, analysis and distribution/access of large data sets. Usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of standard software tools to capture, curate, manage, and process the data within a tolerable elapsed time.\n\n.\n\nWe are in the pre-industrial age of data technology and science used to process and understand data. Yet the early evidence provides hope that we can manage and extract knowledge and wisdom from this data to improve life, business and public services at many levels.\n\n.\n\nTo date, the internet has mostly connected people to information, people to people, and people to business. In the near future, the internet will provide organizations with unprecedented data. The IOT will create an open, global network that connects people, data and machines.\n\n.\n\nBillions of machines, products and things from the physical and organic world will merge with the digital world allowing near real-time connectivity and analysis. Machines and products (and every physical and organic thing) embedded with sensors and software - connected to other machines, networked systems, and to humans - allows us to cheaply and automatically collect and share data, analyze it and find valuable meaning. Machines and products in the future will have the intelligence to deliver the right information to the right people (or other intelligent machines and networks), any time, to any device. When smart machines and products can communicate, they help us and other machines understand so we can make better decisions, act fast, save time and money, and improve products and services.\n\n.\n\nThe IOT, Data Science and Big Data will combine to create a revolution in the way organizations use technology and processes to collect, store, analyze and distribute any and all data required to operate optimally, improve products and services, save money and increase revenues. Simply put, welcome to the new information age, where we have the potential to radically improve human life (or create a dystopia - a subject for another time).\n\n.\n\nThe IOT will produce gigantic amounts of data. Yet data alone is useless - it needs to be interpreted and turned into information. However, most information has limited value - it needs to be analyzed and turned into knowledge. Knowledge may have varying degrees of value - but it needs specialized manipulation to transform into valuable, actionable insights. Valuable, actionable knowledge has great value for specific domains and actions - yet requires sophisticated, specialized expertise to be transformed into multi-domain, cross-functional wisdom for game changing strategies and durable competitive advantage.\n\n.\n\nBig data may provide the operating system and special tools to get actionable value out of data, but the soul of the data, the knowledge and wisdom, is the bailiwick of the data scientist."</span></span>,

      "<span class="hljs-attribute">full_text</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"The 9 Best Free Online Big Data And Data Science Courses\n\nDemand for skilled data scientists continues to be sky-high, with IBM recently predicting that there will be a 28% increase in the number of employed data scientists in the next two years.\n\nBusinesses in all industries are beginning to capitalize on the vast increase in data and the new big data technologies becoming available for analyzing and gaining value from it.\n\nThis makes it a great prospect for anyone looking for a well-paid career in an exciting and cutting-edge field.\n\nBut it isn’t just those following a traditional academic path – such by studying for one of the best US data science masters degreecourses I covered in a recent article – who can benefit.\n\nThere are also a large number of free online courses and tutorials which a motivated individual could use as a springboard into a rewarding and lucrative career.\n\nWho could benefit from a free online data science course?\n\nEmployers are waking up to the fact that employees with the ability to use data and analytics to solve business problems are increasingly valuable, whatever their background or position in an organization.\n\nA lot of this is because of the proliferation of self-service infrastructure and tools designed to automate many of the technical but repetitive tasks involved with data cleaning, preparation and analytics. This means workers are increasingly able to carry out complex data-driven operations such as predictive modelling and automation without getting their hands dirty coding complex algorithms from scratch.\n\nHowever, someone with an understanding of the principles will often be in a better position to use these tools productively than someone without! So, if you are looking to enhance your own CV with analytics skills you could do far worse than look at some of these courses. It’s worth noting however that while you can educate yourself with these courses without spending a penny, some of them charge for certification when you’ve finished.\n\nCoursera – Data Science Specialization\n\nCoursera provides one of the longest-established online data science educations, through John Hopkins University. It isn’t completely free – if you can afford it, you are expected to pay a course and certification fee – but this is waived for students who don’t have the financial resources available.\n\nComprised of 10 courses, the specialization covers statistical programming in R, cluster analysis, natural language processing and practical applications of machine learning. To complete the program, students create a data product which can be used to solve a real-world problem.\n\nCoursera – Data-Driven Decision Making\n\nAlso from Coursera, this course is provided by PwC so unsurprisingly focuses more on business applications than theory. It covers the spectrum of tools and techniques which are being adopted by businesses today to tackle data challenges, and the different roles that data specialists can fill in modern organizations. Students are also tutored on selecting the best tools and frameworks for solving problems with data. The four-week course concludes with a task involving deploying a data solution in a simulated business environment,\n\nEdX – Data Science Essentials\n\nThis course is provided by Microsoft and forms part of their Professional Program Certificate in Data Science, although it can also be taken as a stand-alone course through EdX. Students are expected to have an “introductory” knowledge of R or Python – the two most popular languages for data science programming at the moment. Subjects covered include probability and statistics, data exploration, visualization, and an introduction to machine learning, using the Microsoft Azure framework. Although all of the course material is free, students can pay ($90 in this case) for an official certificate on completion.\n\nUdacity – Intro to Machine Learning\n\nMachine learning is undoubtedly one of the hot topics in data science right now, and this course aims to give a full overview, from theory to practical application. As well as an introduction to selecting data sources and choosing which algorithms best fit a particular problem the course also forms a part of Udacity’s paid-for “nanodegree” in data analysis.\n\nIBM – Data Science Fundamentals\n\nIBM provides a number of free online courses through its portal formerly known as Big Data University and now rebranded as Cognitive Class. This program covers data science 101, methodology, hands-on applications, programming in R and open source tools. Collectively they should take around 20 hours to complete although those with prior experience of computer science will probably progress more quickly, whereas complete beginners may take a little bit longer.\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology – Learning from Data\n\nThis course focuses on machine learning and is delivered as a series of video lectures along with homework assignments and a final exam. As well as an overview of how computers “learn”, it goes into depth with the mathematics (students are expected to have a working knowledge of matrices and calculus, so this one isn’t for complete maths newbies).\n\nDataquest – Become a Data Scientist\n\nDataquest is an independent online training provider rather than being affiliated with a university like most of the others here. It offers free access to much of its course materials although you can also pay for premium services which include tutored projects. It offers three paths – data analyst, data scientist and data engineer, and with endorsements from Uber, Amazon and Spotify it looks like a good way to get a feel for whether or not you will enjoy studying data science, without spending money.\n\nKDNuggets – Data Mining Course\n\nKDNuggets is a well-known business and data science website and it has compiled its own free data mining syllabus. There are modules on machine learning, statistical concepts such as decision trees, regression, clustering and classification (see my data science glossary for an introduction to these terms) as well as an introduction to practical implementations of the technology.\n\nThe Open Source Data Science Masters\n\nRather than being offered by an organization or institution, this course is comprised of a collection of open-source materials and resources, available freely online. Subjects covered include natural language processing of the Twitter API using Python, Hadoop MapReduce, SQL and noSQL databases and data visualization. It also includes a grounding in the algebra and statistics needed to understand the fundamentals of data science. Of course there is no certification but the program can be completed at your own speed and works great as a gateway to the wealth of information on data science available online.\n\nThank you for reading my post.

      "<span class="hljs-attribute">full_text</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"Uber has reinvented transportation. That is an overstatement if we do not look behind the scene to see how Uber has created this turnaround. This company makes it simple for a user to book an Uber – To make this possible, the company collects big data and employs data science. In light of what Uber has accomplished, businesses utilizing their valuable asset, data, and continuously employ data science are surging ahead to beat the competition by a mile.\n\nFrom making better decisions, defining goals, identifying opportunities and classifying target audience to choosing the right talent, data science offers immense value to businesses. How do companies gain industry-specific insights from data science?\n\nManufacturing industry’s gain from data science\n\nData science is creating insight-driven manufacturing. The compelling data science story of Ford indicates how manufacturers take advantage of data. From wireless connections to in-vehicle sensors, Ford is leveraging advancements to gain insights into driver behavior and improve production times.\n\nManufacturers use high-quality data from sensors placed in machines to predict failure rates of equipment; streamline inventory management and optimize factory floor space. For long, manufacturers have been seeking to address equipment downtime. The advent of IoT has allowed manufacturers to make machines talk with one another – the resulting data is leveraged through data science to reduce unplanned equipment downtime.\n\nDynamic response to market demands is another challenge faced by this industry – Line changeover is at the heart of assuring dynamic response; manufacturers are now using the blend of historical line changeover data analysis with product demand to determine effective line transitions. The combination of statistical models and historical data has helped anticipate inventory levels on the shop floor – Manufacturers can determine the number of components required on the shop floor.\n\nData science enters every operation in Retail\n\nThe retail industry is picking nuggets of wisdom from data that is growing exponentially by leveraging data science. Data Scientists at Rolls Royce determine the right time for scheduling maintenance by analyzing airplane engines data. L’Oreal has data scientists working to find out how several cosmetics affect several skin types.\n\nTake customer experience for instance. Retailers now lean on predictive analytics to improve customer experience across devices and channels. Sentiment analysis of product reviews, call center records and social media streams allows the retail industry to gain market insights and customer feedback.\n\nOn the Merchandizing front, retailers make good use of video data analysis to identify cross-selling opportunities as well as shopping trends. They learn behavioral patterns from heat sensors and image analysis for promotional displays, improved layouts and product placements. With the product sensors, they gain insights on post-purchase use.\n\nWhen it comes to marketing, retailers are leveraging data science to ensure personalized offers reach customers’ mobile phones. Retailers promote real-time pricing, run targeted campaigns to segmented customers through appropriate channels and provide tailored offerings through web analytics and online behavioral analysis.\n\nData science also helps retailers benefit from real-time inventory management and tracking. GPS-enabled big data telematics help optimize routes and promote efficient transportation. Retailers are exploiting unstructured and structured data to support demand-driven forecasting.\n\nData science effect on Financial Services sector\n\nFinancial services companies are turning to data science for answers – leveraging new data sources to build predictive models and simulate market events, using NoSQL, Hadoop and Storm to exploit non-traditional data sets and store different data for future analysis.\n\nSentiment analysis has risen into another valuable source to achieve several objectives. With sentiment analysis, banks track trends, respond to issues, monitor product launches and enhance brand perception. They make the most of the market sentiment data to short the market when some unforeseen event occurs.\n\nData science comes to life to automate risk credit management. Take Alibaba’s Aliloan for instance. The automated online system disperses loans to online vendors that face the ordeal of obtaining loans. Alibaba analyses customer ratings, transaction records and other information from data gathered from payment as well as e-commerce platforms to know if a vendor is trustworthy. Financial institutions are utilizing innovative credit scoring techniques to promote automated small loans for the suppliers.\n\nReal-time analytics serve financial institutions’ purpose in fighting fraud. Parameters like spending patterns, account balances, employment details and credit history among others are analyzed by banks to determine if transactions are fair and open. Lenders get a clear understanding of customer’s business operations, assets and transaction history through credit ratings that are updated in real time.\n\nData science also helps financial institutions to know who their customers are – in turn, offer customized products, run relevant campaigns and build products to suit customer segments. Where cutting down risks is an imperative for financial institutions, predictive analytics serves their purpose to the hilt.\n\nTravel industry’s journey with Data Science\n\nWe have moved away from the time when travel companies created customer segments. Today, they get a 360-degree view of every customer and create personalized offers. How is this possible?\n\nTravel companies use a combination of datasets from social media, itineraries, predictive analytics, behavioral targeting and location tracking to arrive at the 360-degree view. For instance, a customer visiting Facebook pages on Zurich can be attracted with discounted offers on flights to Switzerland.\n\nDelta Airlines had planned to give phablet to 19,000 flight attendants. By this way, flight attendants would capture customer preferences and previous travel experiences to provide personalized experiences. The key here is to get a single view of the client.\n\nBig data creates a significant difference for travel companies to promote safer travels. The sensors from trains and other automobiles provide real-time data on various parameters along the journey. This way, companies can predict problems, and more importantly, prevent them. By integrating historical data, advanced booking trends as well as customer behavioral data, travel companies ensure maximum yield, with no vacant seats. Predictive algorithms are proving useful to send drivers to the available parking stations. Data from sources on wind, weather and traffic are being used to predict fuel needs and delays.\n\nBusinesses use data science in a number of ways. Data science is here to give a better picture of the business– move from the static to dynamic results."</span></span>,

      "<span class="hljs-attribute">full_text</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"We have reached the tipping point in big data. We can now access, manage and manipulate massive amounts of data with such ease that the real work has shifted to analysis and practical applications across industries. This new discipline, called data science, will not be exclusive to the male-dominated computer science profession, and a tidal wave of opportunity will arise for women.\n\nThe world of finance, of course, has benefited greatly from data and data science, but most of the action in big data has been reserved for computer scientists. Right now, there are fewer women graduating with computer science degrees than in the 1980s. Nevertheless, as we move from big data to data science, doors will open for more and more women.\n\nWomen now make up 40 percent of graduates with degrees in statistics — that’s a good indicator for women in an environment increasingly obsessed with data. As we’ve seen with most technologies, the code is eventually abstracted away from the user and the dirty work of putting the tech to use in real business situations begins. Women no longer need to be expert coders to get in on the data science game.\n\nIf you have any doubt that women are moving quickly to capitalize on this trend, I encourage you to look at today’s Women in Data Science conference at Stanford University (livestreaming here), which is an unequivocal show of strength for women in the field. It’s hard enough to find a woman at most technology conferences, and I’ve been to quite a few; yet, this data science conference managed to fill out the audience and speaker list exclusively with women.\n\nSo where does this trend go next?\n\nData will meet women where they are\n\nThere has been exhaustive discussion of the underrepresentation of women in technology over the past 10 years, but the solution can’t simply be to enroll more women in university programs. The more direct path to empowerment has just as much to do with applying data science across industries.\n\nConsider the impact that data could have in female-dominated professions. Women are well represented in health care and education, but they also have higher rates of senior management positions in hospitality, professional services and the food and beverage industry.\n\nEach of these industries is well suited to reap the benefits of data science. My own experience in the health and education worlds confirms as much. We are using data to get better drugs to market faster and to personalize treatment plans. In education, we’re using data to better assess and tailor learning across the world while simultaneously getting a clear view of teacher performance across entire school districts.\n\nThe benefits in data-driven decision making in business and administration, which is the most popular degree among today’s female graduates, are well-documented. Data science is already making its mark from sourcing and supply-chain management to HR and customer-experience management. But it’s also about second, third and fourth most popular degrees among women, whose respective fields could all see transformative change if women brought data science into the fold.\n\nWhile women have a strong presence in these roles and industries, competency in data science will help to fast-track their path to senior-level positions and equal pay. They already own the expertise and experience in these positions; data science merely shatters the glass ceiling between them and the C-suite.\n\nData will amplify the social impact of female leaders\n\nWhile data science will create career opportunities for women across the globe, it’s perhaps more important to talk about the opportunity it creates for women to have a larger impact on the world.\n\nToday, women make up 75 percent of the nonprofit workforce. The number is even higher among social workers, where women make up 82 percent of the total. These careers rarely offer the financial benefits available in the for-profit sector, but women choose them anyway.\n\nFor some, this may seem like a poor use of the earning potential of more than 50 percent of our college graduates, but most women would beg to differ. Female entrepreneurs are more likely to use business as a vehicle for social or environmental change, and they are 1.17 times more likely to create social ventures than men. A Georgetown University study revealed one potential driver of this trend: Women are the biggest believers in supporting causes.\n\nAs data science goes mainstream, these women will be armed with tools that help them make a bigger impact on our world.\n\nConsider the collaboration between DC Greens and ClickMedix, where data science made it possible to get more low-income residents of Washington, D.C., access to fresh produce through a new voucher program. Their success in D.C. is now a blueprint for efforts in cities across the country. Both organizations were founded by women that put causes first, and data was the force multiplier for efficacy.\n\nThis is what I expect to see across the globe in the years to come. Female entrepreneurs are already leading the charge for social change. When you’re solving complex, multifaceted problems, progress can be slow, but big data accelerates the process — insights come faster and decisions are more precise.\n\nMost importantly, women capable of fostering sweeping change will wield disproportionate leverage in our politics, business communities and economy.\n\nBias, meet truth\n\nAssuming women are able to capitalize on the opportunities that data science creates, there’s still the challenge of retaining their position at the highest levels of a business. A recent study from the Rockefeller Foundation found that when a company is failing, female CEOs are blamed for poor leadership far more often than male CEOs. The contrast was stark: 80 percent of news stories blamed the female CEOs, compared to 31 percent for men.\n\nI’m encouraged by big data because it will not only empower women, it will level the playing field in the C-suite.\n\nStudies have proven that companies with more women in the C-suite are more profitable than those with fewer women. Other research has shown female CEOs in the Fortune 1000 outperform the S&amp;P 500 over their tenures; yet, only 5 percent of the Fortune 1000 companies have female CEOs, and the “double bind” problem for female leaders persists even today, according to research from Catalyst.\n\nIn the near future, the double standard women face in the workplace will wane as adoption of data-driven decision making grows. Gone are the days of trashing a female executive for her “leadership skills” without taking a closer look at her personal and financial-performance metrics.\n\nFor that very reason data science doesn’t just help women advance their careers, it secures their footing at the top. The result is better-performing businesses, accelerated social change and a global economy that works better for all of us.\n\nDaphne Kis is the CEO of WorldQuant University and a co-founder of Litmus Health, a data-science platform for early-stage clinical trials. Her strong belief in the global empowerment of women in entrepreneurship has motivated her to actively advise and mentor organizations including SheEO, the Women’s Quorum Initiative and the Springboard Enterprises Tech Council.

      "<span class="hljs-attribute">full_text</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"Artificial Intelligence, Why Now ?\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) as a concept has been around a long time and can be traced back to Aristotle in the 4th Century with his deductive reasoning system, and in the 50’s John McCarthy coined the term ‘artificial intelligence’ but in the last few years there has been an explosion of activity.\n\nYou can read a brief history of AI through the years here Brief History of AI, but this article will focus on ‘why now’, is the time that Artificial Intelligence will have a profound and accelerating impact on everyone’s lives.\n\nIn the book Tipping Point by Martin Gladwell Wikipedia Tipping Point he talks about how several factors combining can cause ‘the moment of critical mass’ and how ideas, products, messages and behaviours can spread like viruses. Although there is an element of viral behaviour around AI, everyone jumping on the proverbial ‘band wagon’ there are a number of factors combining to cause the moment of ‘critical mass’.\n\nWhy Now – Exponential Growth &amp; Exponential Reductions\n\nRay Kurzweil coined the term ‘law of accelerating returns’ which talks about the exponential nature of increase, when technology is used to design technology. It moves beyond the linear nature of the what the human brain understands to an exponential curve.\n\nA fitting example of this would be the self-driving car, whilst we might not be quite there yet in terms of fully autonomous cars on all our roads, the quest for an autonomous car has created many innovations which are in our vehicles today, the diagram below from Audi shows that acceleration curve perfectly.\n\nWhile technology is exponentially increasing, costs are exponential decreasing – a great example of this is the cost of sequencing the Genome, which took over a decade to achieve at a cost of around $100m and is now well below the $1000 mark and takes just hours. Genome Sequencing Costs\n\nThis also applies to Compute, Storage and Connectivity costs as shown below. The combination of exponential acceleration of technology, with the exponential reduction in costs – means we are at the junction of an unparalleled time in technology\n\nWhy Now ? The turning point in 2012\n\nTo reinforce the exponential nature of change, in the summer of 2012 twelve of Google’s finest brains built a neural network of 16,000 powerful processors and set themselves the task of identifying all the cat videos on YouTube. At the time, it was a breakthrough in image recognition using neural networks. Google X finds cat videos\n\nIn October 2012 Geoffrey Hinton enlisted two of his Dropout co-writers, Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever and entered a Computer Vision competition with a model trained on just two GPU’s, they wiped the floor with all competition and won every category, less than 6 months had elapsed\n\nWhy Now – Data + Cloud + Algorithms\n\nData – Big Data – Really Big Data!\n\nWe live in a time when data is created everywhere by everything and in unprecedented amounts. The exponential amounts of data led in the 90’s to the words zettabyte and yottabyte being added to the dictionary, they were needed to allow for the rapidly increasing amounts of data being stored.\n\nThis data comes from devices ranging from watches to cars all connecting to the internet with some estimating that a self-driving car alone will generate 100 gigabytes per second.\n\nThe Cloud\n\nAll this data needs to be stored somewhere and the low cost of Cloud computing make it the obvious and accessible place to store it. Most Cloud vendors offer Gigabytes of free storage to consumers, but at an Enterprise level the costs of storing structured and unstructured data are still incredibly low compared with traditional data-centers.\n\nAdd to this the incredible compute power of the Cloud, at the Microsoft Build Conference 2016 a demonstration showed if all the compute capacity of the Azure was used to translate the entire contents of Wikipedia (3 billion words across 5 million articles) from English to Spanish it would take less than a tenth of a second.\n\nAlthough this compute power is unprecedented, it is a requirement for process the large volumes of data we are storing\n\nPowerful Algorithms\n\nOne you have the Data and the Compute Capacity, the next step is to extract ‘intelligence’ from your data, to do this you will likely need to use Machine Learning or Deep Learning.\n\nThe two most popular areas of Deep Learning are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). CNNs are best used for analysis of visual images, see the example before of advances in image recognition. RNNs are better suited to handwriting recognition or speech recognition.\n\nLast year Microsoft was able to transcribe conversational speech at a word error rate of 6.3%, this is equivalent to the ability of a human to transcribe speech. The following month it was able to beat its own previous record at a word error rate of 5.9%, which is more accurate that a human. Earlier this year IBM beat the Microsoft record and achieved 5.5% accuracy. You can probably guess that this will change again before the end of the year.\n\nWhy Now – In Summary\n\nExponential Growth in the capability of Technology\n\nExponential Reduction in Costs\n\nVast amounts of Data available for mining\n\nThe Storage and Compute Capacity of the Cloud\n\nPowerful Algorithms and advances in Data Science\n\nThe combination of all of these factors means we are at the start of a new and exciting age of advancement in Artificial Intelligence, one that will have a profound effect on every person’s life, but also many of these advancements will be so embedded in our everyday lives that they may mostly go unnoticed.\n\nAs always all views are my own and not necessarily those of my employer and you can Follow me on LinkedIn or you can Follow me on Twitter"</span></span>,

        "text": "Data Science and Analytics for Developers\nIn this five-day (three-day for those that have already attended the beginners course, starting Wednesday) comprehensive training course, you will explore many aspects of cutting-edge Data Science. This data science bootcamp combines beginner, intermediate and advanced courses into one efficient program. At the end of this course you will be considered professionally capable of developing and delivering data science products.\nAn intensive 5-day course allows you to fully immerse yourself in data science. You will become confident in all aspects of machine learning. The extra time will allow you to explore more examples and provide more time to learn from the expert tuition.\nThroughout each day, theory will be complemented by “peer-instruction”; a teaching method that improves your learning experience by asking you to solve examples. This will provide you with valuable experience that you can apply to your own problems.\nWho will benefit\nThis course is aimed towards developers, in which we will delve into the mathematics behind the code as well as developing real-life algorithms in Python. One-to-one help will be provided for developers new to Python and all algorithms, frameworks and libraries used will be demonstrated by the instructor.\nThis is a full beginner to advanced level course, which is suitable for most users with limited development experience. Some experience of Python is helpful. No data science experience is expected.\nWhat you will achieve\nEach day will comprise of a series of sub-hour theoretical sessions separated by practical exercises. It will cover a range of topics, but it is expected that you will be able to:\n\nDiscuss the differences between types of learning\nDescribe problems in a way which can be solved with Data Science\nUnderstand the difference between regression and classification\nSolve problems using regression algorithms\nSolve problems using classification algorithms\nLearn how to avoid overfitting and appreciate generalisation\nDevelop features within data\nDescribe how and where to obtain data\nEvaluate models numerically\nInvestigate and assess models visually\nHave practical experience in industrial statistics\nFurther enhance data pre-processing skills\nUnderstand unsupervised learning\nGain experience in a wide variety of Machine Learning algorithms\nDevelop solutions to mine, analyse and classify text\nDiscuss and explain neural networks, deep learning and a range of topologies\nEmploy semi-supervised machine learning to complex problems\nUse ensemble methods to create cutting-edge machine learning products\n\nTopics covered in this training\n\nNumerical and visual model evaluation\nIntroduction and application of statistics in data science\nUnderstand the practical steps to design and deploy models\nFurther experience with real-life messy data\nUnsupervised Machine Learning\nA range of Machine Learning models: e.g. Logistic regression, linear and nonlinear SVMs, decision trees, etc.\nIntroduction to tooling, testing and deployment\nAn in-depth practical example demonstrating the day’s concepts\nNumerical and visual model evaluation\nIntroduction and application of statistics in data science\nUnderstand the practical steps to design and deploy models\nFurther experience with real-life messy data\nUnsupervised Machine Learning\nA range of Machine Learning models: e.g. Logistic regression, linear and nonlinear SVMs, decision trees, etc.\nIntroduction to tooling, testing and deployment\nAn in-depth practical example demonstrating the day’s concepts\nText feature engineering\nText mining, representation and learning\nNeural networks\nDeep belief networks\nStacked denoising autoencoders\nConvolutional neural networks\nSemi-supervised machine learning\nEnsemble methods\nAn in-depth practical example demonstrating the day’s concepts\n\nFAQ\nWhat equipment do I need to bring?\nYou must bring your own laptop.\nWhat software do I need to install?\nWe will use an online environment, so no extra software is necessary. However, if you wish to run the workshops locally then you will need to install Docker.\nWhat language will this be in?\nThis training is delivered in English.\nDo you provide lunch?\nYes, lunch is included. If you have any dietary requirements, please get in touch.\nWhere exactly is the location?\nThe location will be announced approximately one month before the event. This is to ensure we can book the right size room for the number of attendees.\nBusiness Purchasers\nWe are happy to invoice businesses directly.

At the moment im taking the EDX Microsoft Cert Just yo get some básic knowledge about it. It hasnt been easy i started the introduction and saw languajes like sql,XML,html,css, and jason... And they assumed i already knew about them so took a step back went to w3school learneld all those above, i still feel my sql is At the beginner level. Went back to the course and im currently in the 4th. My questions are\n\n\nIs there any kind of forums for beginners to share experiences and tips?\n\nWhat type of hardware should i focus more in  new laptop CPU or RAM? Im currently using Azure and honestly im beginning to think that it does not matter as you do everything On the cloud.\n\nWhat types of jobs does big data scientist take? Any freelancer out there? Do you normally get a job At \"X\" company and Just do  research or you end up as full time database cleaner and part time researcher?\n\nIs it a good time to start learning big data for my profesional growth? Or is a oversaturated market? Im currently taking it as a hobby, but i think im falling in love with big data.\n\nWhen do you say i know big data, and start thinking about getting a job? Is there like a real capstone that says hey im a big data researcher!!\n\nWhat books or courses do you suggest to take to get a better foundation for big data?\n\n\nThx and sorry for the typos, 4inch phone is killing my figers and inner grammar nazi."</span>

The coal in sizes from 3-25 mm works, but the smaller particles (&amp;lt;3 mm) or “fines” are wasted in the reactor as they get airborne and are burnt up without reacting. The Seeker would like to screen out the fines and make briquettes that could survive the tumbling and temperature of the rotary kiln such that they could take part in the reduction reaction. A method to make briquettes with the proper strength and properties is required. Binders/additives could be used, but they must not chemically interfere with the reaction, the kiln or increase impurities significantly in the product.  \nThe submission to the Challenge should include the following:  \n \n A detailed description of your proposed Solution addressing specific Solution Requirements presented in the Detailed Description of the Challenge. This description should be accompanied by a well-articulated rationale supported by literature/patent precedents. \n A demonstration of your ability to briquette coal using Solver obtained samples. \n If the Seeker finds suitable candidates, they will provide samples for testing the solutions.   \n \nReceipt of a Challenge award is contingent upon theoretical evaluation and experimental validation of the submitted Solutions by the Seeker.  \nTo receive a Challenge award, you, the Solver, will have to transfer to the Seeker your exclusive Intellectual Property (IP) rights to the solution.   \nSubmissions to this Challenge must be received by 11:59 PM (US Eastern Time) on June 11, 2018.

Effective treatment options for these debilitating and fatal conditions are severely limited. Although there has been much progress in recent years unraveling disease mechanisms, the underlying causes of these diseases are not well understood. Even in cases where disease-causing mutations have been identified, it is still unclear how they lead to neuronal death, and ultimately, to the specific cognitive and/or motor deficits associated with each disorder.   \nMigraine, headache disorders and chronic pain are additional areas of unmet need. An estimated 1.5 billion people globally suffer from chronic pain, and in one in three people the ability to sustain an independent lifestyle is impaired due to pain. Furthermore, about 100 million people in the United States suffer from headaches, of which 37 million have migraines. Migraine sufferers typically suffer from moderate to severe pain limiting their participation in normal activities and impacting their overall quality of life. Effective treatments without deleterious side effects are urgently needed.   \nThe key to discovering effective treatments lies in understanding the basic mechanism or pathophysiology of the condition, thus uncovering new pathways and targets. Successful proposals for this Challenge should focus on novel intracellular or extracellular targets that can be modulated by small molecules or biologics to alleviate the conditions of people suffering from neurodegenerative disorders, including ALS, HD and PD, as well as migraine, headache disorders, or pain.  \nThis is an electronic Request-for-Partners (eRFP) Challenge. The Solver will write a proposal (maximum of 10 pages, not including references and contact details) to be evaluated by Teva.  \nThe ALS Association and the Huntington’s Disease Society of America (HDSA) are partnering with Teva and co-sponsoring the Challenge awards to seek novel targets with therapeutic potential for ALS and HD, respectively.  \nThe top submissions will be considered for awards ranging from $10,000 to $30,000. Up to $40,000 in cash awards may be distributed. Solvers are NOT eligible for multiple awards. The award has no strings attached; Teva does not request ownership of intellectual property. In addition, if there is mutual interest of the parties, Teva may invite selected Solvers to work out terms for a collaboration contract to further investigate the target. The monetary value of the contract will vary depending on the amount of work to be delivered and the agreed time frame.  \n[NOTE: Proposals from Solvers who have the ability to work as a collaboration partner are not required, but are highly encouraged.]  \nSubmissions to this Challenge must be received by 11:59 PM (US Eastern Time) on April 29, 2018.   \nLate submissions will not be considered.  \n&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.innocentive.com/projectImages/ck-images/Image/logos_Teva.PNG\"&gt;  \nABOUT THE SEEKER  \nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

Neuronal loss is associated with conformational changes in proteins that result in extra- or intra-cellular accumulation of misfolded proteins, representing the hallmarks of several neurodegenerative disorders, summarized as proteinopathies. Intermediate forms such as oligomers or protofibrils are thought to have cytotoxic effects to neurons, offering new ways for future prevention and treatment strategies.  \nOur Research department within the Neuropsychiatry Center of Therapeutic Innovation is mainly focused on such intrinsically disordered protein (tau, α-synuclein, Aβ) aggregation processes related to Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. In the context of Alzheimer’s disease, one of our strategies is to search for compounds able to prevent tau aggregate formation. Therefore, the Seeker desires a suitable cell-free assay that allows the robust and reproducible monitoring of tau protein aggregation.  \nThis Theoretical Challenge requires only a written proposal."</span></span>,

      "<span class="hljs-attribute">overview</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"Reclamation and its collaborators are seeking methods and technology that can reliably, efficiently, and cost-effectively detect leaks and flaws in buried, large-diameter, operational water pipeline infrastructure. (Note: For the purposes of this Challenge, the word “operational” should be understood to mean “containing flowing water”, either pressurized or unpressurized.)  \nAs the nation’s largest wholesale water supplier, the Reclamation builds and maintains pipelines that provide irrigation water for farmland and drinking water for household consumption.  Pipeline leaks and flaws cause the loss of a valuable resource, reduce water delivery reliability, and often necessitate long service outages and costly repairs.  Though leaks and flaws can emerge at any time in a pipeline’s lifecycle, many systems have been in service for substantial portions of their original design lifetimes; this aging pipeline infrastructure is increasingly susceptible to failure.   \nMany available methods of pipeline leak and flaw detection are not practical or applicable for large diameter operational pipelines.  Advances in leak and flaw detection are needed to enable timely repairs.  Proposed solutions must be applicable to steel pipe and prestressed concrete cylinder pipe (PCCP) with diameters greater than 48 inches.  Proposed solutions that can be applied to all pipelines regardless of pipe diameter or type will be given greater weight in evaluation.  Proposed solutions must be cost effective and scalable to pipelines with lengths approximately 100 miles.  \n   \nCHALLENGE STAGES &amp;amp; PRIZE  \nThis Challenge consists of two stages:  \n&lt;ul&gt; \n Stage 1 is a Theoretical Challenge requiring submission of a white paper that describes novel technologies for detecting leaks and flaws in water pipelines.  Stage 1 may award up to five prizes from a total prize award pool of $75,000. \n If Stage 1 proves successful, Stage 2 is planned as a subsequent Reduction-to-Practice (RTP) Challenge to provide proof-of-concept in a laboratory-scale and/or field-scale demonstration. Stage 2 is anticipated to have a larger prize purse than Stage 1.  In addition to the direct monetary award for Stage 2, Reclamation will invite industry, non-profit organizations, and venture capital representatives to the Stage 2 presentations and testing.  Participating industry, non-profit organization, and venture capital representatives will have the ability to seek and secure potential business deals with Solvers.  Stage 2 will be opened to the public for new submissions (not only to those who participated in Stage 1). New Solvers may be requested to provide theoretical background information equivalent to that solicited in Stage 1. \n&lt;/ul&gt; \nThis posting only launches the Stage 1 competition. If Stage 2 is conducted, it will be officially launched and announced with a separate Challenge posting.  \nStage 1 is a Theoretical Challenge that requires only a written proposal to be submitted. Reclamation has a total cash prize purse budget of $75,000 for Stage 1, as stated in the &lt;a href=\"https://www.innocentive.com/ar/projectRoom/index?challenge=9933883\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Challenge-Specific Solver Agreement&lt;/a&gt;.  The minimum full award amount is $15,000. Reclamation can allocate higher individual award amounts up to the prize purse of $75,000, as it deems appropriate. The Challenge award will be contingent upon results of critical analysis and evaluation by Reclamation and the judging panel appointed by Reclamation.  A total of up to five awards can be made for the highest ranked submissions meeting or exceeding the requirements (“Solution Requirements”) described in the Challenge details.  However, the meeting of the Solution Requirements does not guarantee that the proposed solution will be awarded by Reclamation.  Partial cash prizes may be considered for solutions that meet some, but not all, of the criteria.  \nSubmissions to this Challenge must be received by 11:59 PM (US Eastern Time) on May 8, 2018. Late submissions will not be considered.  \n   \nJUDGING  \nAfter the Challenge submission deadline, a Judging Panel will evaluate the submissions and decide the winning solution(s). The Judging Panel may be composed of Federal and/or Non-Federal scientists, engineers, and other technical experts, including subject matter experts from the listed collaborators for this Challenge.  All Solvers that submit a proposal will be notified on the status of the submissions. Decisions by Reclamation cannot be contested.  \n   \nIMPORTANT ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION  \nSolvers do not have to participate in Stage 1 to be eligible to participate in Stage 2. Stage 1 participants are not required to compete in Stage 2.  \n \n To receive an award, Solvers will not have to transfer their exclusive intellectual property (IP) rights to Reclamation. Instead, Solvers will grant Reclamation a non-exclusive license to use and practice their solutions. Solvers who have transferred their IP rights in their solution to a third party, or otherwise entered into any commercial exclusive arrangement with another for the exploitation of their IP rights in their solution prior to the end of the Challenge shall not be eligible for a Challenge award. Please note that any proposal submitted will not be treated as confidential information.  Accordingly, Solvers should protect their proprietary rights in their solutions prior to submitting their written proposal for consideration in the Challenge (e.g. filing provisional or full patent applications on the solution described in the written proposal prior to submission). See the &lt;a href=\"https://www.innocentive.com/ar/projectRoom/index?challenge=9933883\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Challenge-Specific Agreement&lt;/a&gt; for full details.  \n This Challenge is being conducted by Reclamation under the authority of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (&lt;a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title15/pdf/USCODE-2011-title15-chap63-sec3719.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;15 U.S. C. § 3719&lt;/a&gt;) as amended by the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017 (&lt;a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ329/PLAW-114publ329.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;PL-114-329&lt;/a&gt;), which states that cash prize purse awards for this Challenge may only be given to an individual that is a citizen or permanent resident of the United States, or an entity that is incorporated in and whose primary place of business is in the United States, subject to verification by Reclamation before cash prize purses are awarded.

This process is essential to enhance the strength and the safety of glass sheets. The downside is that the surface treatments that give commercially valuable properties to glass do not necessarily survive such extreme temperatures. Water-repellency is one of such cases. Water-repellency is very appealing since it leads to enhanced glass functionality: ease of cleaning, higher visibility and safety for automotive glazing, lower maintenance. This property is usually achieved via coatings with organic compounds, and therefore not suitable for the exposure to tempering.  \nThe Seeker is challenging Solvers to come forth with methods that can give to the glass sheets the much needed water-repellent properties and survive the extremely high temperatures (600 to 700 degrees C) that the glass substrate is subjected to during processing. Methods that achieve the required properties during the exposure to the high temperatures of tempering are also welcome. Please read the Detailed Challenge Description for further details.  \nThe submission to the Challenge should include the following:  \n \n The detailed description of the proposed Solution addressing specific Solution Requirements presented in the Detailed Description of the Challenge. This description should be accompanied by a well-articulated rationale supported by literature/patent precedents. \n Experimental proof-of-concept data obtained as outlined in the Detailed Description of the Challenge (and/or delivery of a material sample if requested by the Seeker).  The Seeker is also interested in purely theoretical solutions but these qualify only for a partial award of up to $15,000.    \n \nThe Challenge award is contingent upon theoretical evaluation and experimental validation of the submitted Solutions by the Seeker.  \nTo receive an award, the Solvers will have to transfer to the Seeker their exclusive Intellectual Property (IP) rights to the solution.
